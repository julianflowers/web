European environmental organisation is looking to expand its number of rewilding landscapes – areas where endangered wildlife is reintroduced and protected – after being awarded a grant of £4.1m.<\/p> <p>The grant has been pledged to <a href=\"https://rewildingeurope.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwio6XBhCMARIsAC0u9aHa1-Ih4mNTMcU-MiOQVpclwFWUxiHK4-mK0YnnQEjQNKA5DR3r4AoaAmj_EALw_wcB\">Rewilding Europe<\/a> in the hope of scaling up rewilding efforts throughout several parts of the European continent. <\/p> <p>Rewilding Europe has linked the reintroduction and preservation of wildlife with stabilising the climate, <a href=\"https://rewildingeurope.com/blog/restored-wildlife-populations-could-play-a-game-changing-role-stabilising-our-climate/#:~:text=By%20enabling%20wildlife%20populations%20to,populations%20they%20host%20as%20well\">claiming in a post earlier this year<\/a> that “enabling wildlife populations to recover in both number and diversity … could significantly reduce atmospheric carbon and move us beyond net zero”. The organisation also believes there could be real benefits to local economies, through wildlife and nature-related tourism, such as the <a href=\"https://www.europeansafaricompany.com/\">European Safari Company<\/a>, whose locations include several Rewilding Europe landscapes.<\/p> <p>Founded in June 2011 in Nijmegen, Netherlands, the non-profit organisation already operates a number of existing projects in regions including the Affric Highlands in Scotland, Swedish Lapland, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/nov/04/where-the-wild-things-are-a-trip-to-romanias-southern-mountains\">southern Carpathians<\/a> in Romania and the Greater Côa Valley in Portugal. With the help of the funding, an unspecified 10th rewilding landscape will be launched at the end of the year, with a further five being opened before 2030.<\/p> <p>Animals already reintroduced into the wild include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/18/wild-bison-return-to-uk-for-first-time-in-thousands-of-years\">bison in Kent<\/a>, the first time in thousands of years that the large bovines have been seen in the area, as well deer and even a breed of cattle that resemble the extinct aurochs returning to the areas they previously called home. <\/p> <p>The grant was awarded to the Dutch organisation by British based charity the <a href=\"https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/\">Arcadia Fund<\/a>. Formed in 2002 by husband-and-wife team Peter Baldwin and Lisbet Rausing, both historians, the fund aims to “preserve endangered cultural heritage, protect endangered ecosystems and promote access to knowledge”.<\/p> <p>The charity had made a previous donation of £1.4m to Rewilding Europe in 2019, and since 2021, it has donated around £62.5m to other environmental causes. <\/p> <p>With the grant, Rewilding Europe is hoping to “support wildlife comeback and coexistence” as well as launch the European Wildlife Recovery Fund towards the end of September this year. Part of this includes repopulating areas, with an emphasis being put on large herbivores including bison and wild horses. While many species that have left their habitats come back naturally, some need to be reintroduced by humans.<\/p> <p>Frans Schepers, executive director of Rewilding Europe, expressed his gratitude to the Arcadia Fund, saying that he was “thrilled, humbled and hugely gratified” by the continued trust placed in them by Arcadia.<\/p> <p>Schepers, who was one of Rewilding’s four co-founders more than a decade ago, said the grant would also contribute significantly to their “Strategy 2030”, a strategic plan initiated in 2021, that sets the year 2030 as a deadline to expand the number of rewilding landscapes across the continent from 10 to 15.<\/p> <p>While the new landscapes are yet to be announced, it has been confirmed that they will include marine and coastal ecosystems, a first for the project, and will bring the combined area to around 8m hectares, roughly the size of Scotland.<\/p>","<h2>1 Gorongosa, Mozambique<\/h2> \n<p>Mozambique’s civil war (1977-1992) and the poaching connected to it decimated wildlife in <a href=\"https://gorongosa.org/\">Gorongosa national park<\/a>. Since 2006, the Gorongosa restoration project has set out to bring back nature, starting with buffalo, wildebeest, eland, zebra and other animals being trucked in.<\/p> \n<p>Many species have also recovered naturally under the renewed protection of the park’s 300 rangers. A recent aerial census counted more than 100,000 large animals, including about 200 lions. Three founder packs of African wild dogs and six leopards have also been brought in from South Africa.<\/p> \n<p>This July, conservationists are planning to bring in spotted hyenas from Mozambique’s Karingani game reserve. Hyenas are critical to an ecosystem because, unlike other carnivores, they scavenge dead animals, preventing outbreaks of disease. <\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"34f81ded-7e3f-47a3-8d82-f05f0fb147ae\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is rewilding?<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>Rewilding is the restoration of nature in places altered by human activity. From releasing apex predators&nbsp;such as&nbsp;jaguars and wolves to making space for native grasslands in urban areas, rewilding can happen on a big or small scale. <br>While there are competing definitions, most have the rebuilding of sustainable ecological health at their core,&nbsp;be it the return of kelp forests on the Sussex coast in England or the reintroduction of mockingbirds on the Galápagos Islands.<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Why has the term become so popular?<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>Rewilding has captured the public's imagination&nbsp;by being an environmental movement and a science-based process at the same time. With visions of a wilder planet, high<b>-<\/b>profile environmentalists&nbsp;such as&nbsp;David Attenborough and George Monbiot inspired millions with paths to a more biodiverse, ecologically healthy&nbsp;future. The success of rewilding pioneers around the world has shown what is possible: from the restoration&nbsp;of Gorongosa national park in Mozambique after the civil war to the Knepp estate in the south of England.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Does rewilding have universal support? <\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>No. Critics of rewilding fear that the term is being used to justify the removal of humans from&nbsp;the&nbsp;landscape, especially farmers and indigenous communities. In the UK, some have dismissed the concept as a fad for&nbsp;'toffs'&nbsp;and landowners with vast incomes, while others fear it&nbsp;is&nbsp;being used to attack agricultural&nbsp;communities who have farmed areas for hundreds of years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Can you rewild? <\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>While the boldest rewilding initiatives take place at a landscape scale, small changes can have a big impact. Millions of people changing how they mow their grass or let nature into their gardens, balconies and window sills can add up, providing more space for biodiversity to recover.&nbsp;<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n   <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n <\/gu-atom> \n<\/figure> \n<p>“The loss of each predator in an ecosystem can have serious implications because of their top-down control of other species in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/trophic-cascades-across-diverse-plant-ecosystems-80060347/#:~:text=Trophic%20cascades%20are%20powerful%20indirect,the%20next%20lower%20trophic%20level.\">trophic cascades<\/a>,” says António Paulo, Gorongosa’s veterinarian, who is overseeing the carnivore<em> <\/em>reintroductions. “To reverse this situation, we have worked to rewild this amazing place with predators.”<\/p> \n<p>There has also been extensive reforestation around Mount Gorongosa, and local farmers have been encouraged to move away from slash-and-burn agriculture to more sustainable practices, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/16/ecofriendly-peruvian-coffee-biodiversity-indigenous-aoe\">shade-grown coffee<\/a>. <\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0f4ab8e1c68923b0a8cd189093329f12e496d3c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0f4ab8e1c68923b0a8cd189093329f12e496d3c/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lioness sits in front of a herd of waterbucks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The loss of predators from an ecosystem can have serious consequences, so conservationists have worked to reintroduce them to Gorongosa.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dos Santos/Courtesy of Gorongosa National Park<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p><strong>How to visit<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>A full day in an open safari vehicle includes a picnic lunch and, if you’re lucky, a glimpse of nocturnal animals on your way back.

The former CEO of outdoor clothing company Patagonia and her husband, Doug, the co-founder of North Face, were invited to visit the Iberá wetlands, the second largest in the world, in 1997. The country’s national park service hoped they would buy land. But when they arrived, Kris says, she was not interested. “It was incredibly hot and buggy. I told Doug: ‘Let’s get out of here. This is Nowheresville,’” she recalls. “Doug wasn’t saying much,” she adds.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"5b4c5e639aa9c178cf44ae1eb8b6a8edb28cf514\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b4c5e639aa9c178cf44ae1eb8b6a8edb28cf514/1412_0_2040_2552/799.jpg\" alt=\"Douglas Tompkins and his wife Kristine\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kris and Doug Tompkins at their house in Iberá, Corrientes province, Argentina, in 2009<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel García/AFP/Getty Images<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"bfba18fa90c5c652dac6e5e79ac22ec92fa24d3c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfba18fa90c5c652dac6e5e79ac22ec92fa24d3c/918_0_1667_2083/800.jpg\" alt=\"Anteater is fed from a bottle\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anteater is fed from a bottle<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matias Rebak/Fundacion Rewilding Argentina<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Above left: Kris and Doug Tompkins at their home in the Iberá national park in 2009.

But a month or so later, Doug returned to buy 63,000 hectares (155,000 acres) of land in the middle of the swamp. The buying spree escalated, spurred by the collapse of the Argentinian peso in the 2001 economic crisis. By 2010, they owned 765,000 hectares of land in Argentina and Chile. They had also bought temperate rainforest in Chile and degraded puma habitat in the Andes. At their peak, they helped preserve an area the size of Latvia.<\/p> \n<p>Not everyone was happy that an American couple were buying enormous tracts of land for conservation in the “Southern Cone”, as the southernmost areas of South America are known. The couple clashed with the presidents of Chile and Argentina, the Catholic church, the salmon industry and cattle ranchers, among others. <\/p> \n<p>“Some people thought we were creating a new Jewish state, even though we were Anglican. Others said we were making a nuclear waste site for the United States, naval bases for Argentina to finish off Chile [or] taking out all of the cows and replacing them with American buffalo,” Kris remembers.<\/p> \n<p>Their conservation model has, however, silenced many critics. Once land is restored, it is typically given to the government as a protected area on the condition the returning flora and fauna are conserved.<\/p> \n<p>With governments considering proposals to protect 30% of the planet for nature, successful examples of landscape-scale restoration are vital but few in number. Along with <a href=\"https://gorongosa.org/\">Gorongosa national park in Mozambique<\/a> and the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/928/\">Guanacaste conservation area in Costa Rica<\/a>, the work of what would become Rewilding Argentina stands out as an example of what is possible when nature is given a chance to recover.<\/p> \n<p>“Our achievements in Argentina, where environmental damage has been profound, should give hope that there’s still time for South America and the rest of the world,” says Sofia Heinonen, CEO of Rewilding Argentina.<\/p> \n<p>In Iberá, Doug was quick to notice the absence of river otters, tapirs, peccaries, jaguars and giant anteaters that had largely been hunted to extinction. Most are now on the road to recovery. In Patagonia, the beleaguered puma populations have since begun to recover.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"515f262983d6f6c8659eacab40f14e9ad6e2dc85\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/515f262983d6f6c8659eacab40f14e9ad6e2dc85/0_0_2500_1669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sea lion colony and sea bird rookeries on Islas Blancas, near Camarones, on the Atlantic coast of Argentine Patagonia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sea lion colony and seabird rookeries on Islas Blancas, on the Atlantic coast of Argentinian Patagonia<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beth Wald<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbb27fe7588df35090ab7ab8b95b9fa8e835e777\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbb27fe7588df35090ab7ab8b95b9fa8e835e777/0_574_8660_5199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A giant anteater at a Rewilding Argentina sanctuary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A giant anteater at a Rewilding Argentina sanctuary<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fundacion Rewilding Argentina<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Top: A sea lion colony and seabird rookeries on Islas Blancas, Argentinian Patagonia.

Amid the heartache, Kris was left with the responsibility for vast protected areas in Chile and Argentina. Following Doug’s death, Rewilding Argentina and Rewilding Chile were launched as independent organisations and continue their work on restoration. Tompkins private land also continues to be turned into national parks in both countries, including five new protected areas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/29/chile-creates-five-national-parks-in-patagonia\"> covering 10m acres in Patagonia<\/a>, Chile.<\/p> \n<h2><strong>* * *<\/strong><\/h2> \n<h2>Chapter three<\/h2> \n<h2><strong>How the capybara lost its fear<\/strong><\/h2> \n<p><br>There are enough examples of ecosystem dysfunction in Argentina for a dystopian update to Rudyard Kipling’s Just So Stories: how the macaw forgot how to fly; how the capybara lost its fear; how the giant river otter forgot how to fish. But the decline is being reversed in places.<\/p> \n<p>The most obvious sign of natural imbalance in Iberá is the dozens of capybaras that sprawl over the road, basking in the sun and only ambling off only when a car approaches. Until recently, there was little for the world’s largest rodents to fear in this landscape. Jaguars were hunted out of existence here 70 years ago. Pumas are still rare. <\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21237d07c2b7fc2cea5b7195761119f859cf9028\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21237d07c2b7fc2cea5b7195761119f859cf9028/0_381_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A capybara family in water\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Capybara (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris)<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: edurivero/Getty Images/iStockphoto<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Capybaras may need to change their behaviour with the return of the jaguar<\/p><\/li> \n<\/ul> \n<p>Today, however, capybaras have reason to worry about what might be hiding in the long grass and marshland around them. So far, eight jaguars have been released into Iberá. The giant rodents are a favourite for the returning apex predators, and biologists are waiting to see whether sunbathing in the open remains a popular pastime.<\/p> \n<p>Further north in Iberá, some species require more help. Red macaws became extinct in the region more than 100 years ago but through the work of Rewilding Argentina, a small population is making a comeback. Last year, a pair bred in the wild for the first time.<\/p> \n<p>The path to reintroducing macaws is complicated. Before they are released, the birds must complete a four-stage training programme at a centre on the outskirts of Corrientes, a three-hour drive from the wetlands. Some macaws need to be taught to find food, others need to learn how to fly, socialise in groups and recognise predators. The process can take years. Some never pass through all the stages.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"fec65db67911fe07e47e2e3db9cfa8ae2415ad01\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec65db67911fe07e47e2e3db9cfa8ae2415ad01/1390_0_3610_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Whiteboard with picture of red macaw and detailed flowchart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whiteboard with picture of red macaw and detailed flowchart<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matias Rebak/The Guardian<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"5ad96e86b66a93569542a46da02c5c5634c8ebc0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ad96e86b66a93569542a46da02c5c5634c8ebc0/1781_1496_2504_2504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elena Martín\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elena Martín, a Spanish trainer for Rewilding Argentina on the outskirts of Corrientes.<br><\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Greenfield/The Guardian<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8929423f321885d8dd51a7b6fbf0e7465a7dee91\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8929423f321885d8dd51a7b6fbf0e7465a7dee91/652_29_2094_1257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macaw flies inside aviary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A red macaw in training<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matias Rebak/Fundacion Rewilding Argentina<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Elena Martín, top right, oversees the macaw breeding project.

With visions of a wilder planet, high<b>-<\/b>profile environmentalists&nbsp;such as&nbsp;David Attenborough and George Monbiot inspired millions with paths to a more biodiverse, ecologically healthy&nbsp;future.

In the UK, some have dismissed the concept as a fad for&nbsp;'toffs'&nbsp;and landowners with vast incomes, while others fear it&nbsp;is&nbsp;being used to attack agricultural&nbsp;communities who have farmed areas for hundreds of years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Can you rewild? <\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>While the boldest rewilding initiatives take place at a landscape scale, small changes can have a big impact.

In an urban context, that means creating some big areas where nature is allowed to function: pockets of wildness in our parks, on rooftops, along riverbanks. I think rewilding is a mass movement.”<\/p> \n<p>The figures are based on self-identification. If a council endorsed rewilding or said they were undertaking rewilding activities, they were included as a yes. Councils that rejected the term, even if they were undertaking activities that could be considered rewilding, were included as a no. The exception to this was when “rewilding” actions clearly did not extend beyond reduced mowing of grassy areas.<\/p> \n<p>While there have been several attempts to define rewilding, there is no uniform approach, although scientists are increasingly describing <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/commissions/commission-ecosystem-management/our-work/cems-thematic-groups/rewilding\">the term along a spectrum<\/a> from total human modification to wilderness, with activities that make an area more natural described as rewilding.<\/p> \n<p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here<\/a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston<\/a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield<\/a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features<\/em><\/p>","<p>It’s odd to hear the owners of the UK’s pioneering rewilding project at Knepp estate in West Sussex gushing about farming.

Now Knepp Wildland is a <a href=\"https://knepp.co.uk/home\">1,400 hectare (3,500 acre) rewilding project<\/a>, home to a smörgåsbord of remarkable wildlife, including critically endangered <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22709696/111760622\">nightingales<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22690419/154373407\">turtle doves<\/a>.

For decades, land scattered around the villages of Shipley and Dial Post was run by a tenant farmer who used it for grazing sheep. But the farmer has left and it is being scruffed up and transformed into the Knepp estate regenerative farm, which will supply local food to a new farm shop and cafe, due to open later this year. They are also opening a market garden, which will make use of manure from the cows. Knepp visitors will be able to go on farm safaris, just like they do on the rewilding project.<\/p> <p>I meet the couple in a farmyard which, until 2000, had been a commercial dairy for a century. At the moment it’s a big empty yard but it won’t be quiet for long. They already have 40 Sussex cattle in their regenerative farming herd, rising to 130 over the next 12 months. The barns are likely to house cattle over the winter months, when the clay fields become too wet underfoot. One of the cows – an unplanned pregnancy – gave birth in the barn just after I left.<\/p> <p>The “king and queen of rewilding”, as Burrell and Tree have been labelled, are normally photographed in front of a piece of scrub, standing in long grass or caressing an old oak tree. Today, their backdrop is a mess of barbed wire, some old fenceposts and a barn full of hay. It’s not your typical bucolic scene, but removing obsolete tangles of wire and beefing up hedgerows is part of bringing nature back to this farm.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bce5ba84c11f62275ef94b4424c93b1f7ece0083\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bce5ba84c11f62275ef94b4424c93b1f7ece0083/0_0_6498_4332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A couple stand in a farmyard amid a pile of rusting wire fencing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree, owners of the Knepp estate, stand by old barbed wire fencing pulled out of hedgerows around the farm.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Making their vision a reality requires a sizeable investment. The couple have injected £250,000 into the project, which their farm manager, Russ Carrington, expects to pay back over 20 years. The money will buy cattle, a cattle crush (which holds the animals still while they are examined), a cow brush (which allows them to scratch themselves), hurdles and gates, fencing, polytunnels and a caravan for interns.<\/p> <p>By year five, Carrington hopes to start turning a profit, although this is difficult to predict when the future of post-Brexit government farming grants remains uncertain. Burrell and Tree are fortunate in that revenue from rewilding will help to finance this relatively risky project.

The main principles include limiting soil disturbance, growing a diversity of plants all year and keeping roots in the soil as much as possible.<\/p> <p>Burrell says: “Every time you plough, you are turning a whole living world upside down, and they’ve got to start again. If you keep doing that for long enough, you’re going to kill everything off. When you think of it like that, the regenerative agricultural movement just makes complete sense.”<\/p> <p>An important part of the project will be in-depth baseline surveys. They have taken soil samples from eight fields, including one control sample from a neighbour’s non-organic field, and also surveyed insect populations. Burrell is excited about the development of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/13/airborne-dna-used-to-detect-insect-species-in-breakthrough-for-ecologists\">airborne environmental DNA (eDNA)<\/a> to get even more complex data on water, soil and air samples.<\/p> <p>Tests will be done every five years. “We’re going to see if it’s right or wrong,” he says. “We’ll tease out on this bit of land what that looks like – we started with this and end up with that, and then we talk about it. Everything has to be as truthful as you can possibly make it. You’re not trying to push one particular idea.”<\/p> <p>In the rewilding project, biodiversity is the product with meat as a byproduct. On the regenerative farm, meat is the product, and biodiversity the byproduct. The livestock density on the rewilding side is 0.25 units a hectare, while the density on the farm will be four times greater.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"069f725363f43e7aac9c2b68fbc574734da3ce17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/069f725363f43e7aac9c2b68fbc574734da3ce17/0_0_6556_4371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A farmer holds a reel of wire followed by a herd of red cattle \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carrington unwinds an electric fence to ‘move the mob’ of cattle towards fresh grass around the estate.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>The issue of eating meat is one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/09/the-cow-in-the-room-why-is-no-one-talking-about-farming-at-cop26-aoe\">thorniest<\/a>, with conflicting views about what is the right amount to consume.

Carrington has been fencing off hedgerows so they start billowing out, providing more habitat for scrubland species generally tidied out of conventional farms. Like rivers, hedgerows are wildlife highways, linking the regenerative farm to the rewilding project. Dead wood will be left to rot, and boggy, unproductive patches of ground will be encouraged rather than removed. These features will help to provide a network in the landscape for wildlife to move through and find food.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/10/days-of-wine-and-olives-how-the-old-farming-ways-are-paying-off-spain-aoe\">Days of wine and olives: how the old farming ways are paying off in Spain<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>“If I was just trying to make money on this land, I wouldn’t do it that differently.

It’s a misnomer that we can’t revert some land to nature because people will starve elsewhere in the world.”<\/p> <p>He added: “It’s an exciting time.

Farmers who are unwilling to change are going to find it very difficult to continue as they were.”<\/p>","<p>London will be “rewilded” with new nature reserves, pocket parks and a mass community movement to bring nature back to the capital, the Guardian can reveal.<\/p> <p>A group of rewilding experts commissioned by the mayor, Sadiq Khan, are in the early stages of drawing up the proposal. The idea came from Ben Goldsmith, a financier and environment campaigner who is on the board of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.<\/p> <p>The plan includes a selection of “core rewilding areas” on the outskirts of London, which could involve turning parts of the Thames estuary into a wetland teeming with wading birds and other wildlife, and releasing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/02/beavers-set-to-be-released-london-urban-rewilding\">beavers into the marshes<\/a> around the periphery of the capital. Beavers have already been released in Enfield, to the delight of locals, and there are more set to be released in Ealing later this year.<\/p> <p>These will then be connected by “nature corridors” that could run alongside train lines and on brownfield sites crisscrossing the city, which the wildlife could travel along. This would also create new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/access-to-green-space\">wild green space<\/a> for people to enjoy.<\/p> <p>The third prong of the plan is to involve Londoners, who will be encouraged to bring nature into their gardens, window boxes – and even on to their roofs.<\/p> <p>Shirley Rodrigues, the London deputy mayor for environment, said: “In London there are differences in how people can access green space – this isn’t just an environmental issue, it is a social justice issue. We have academics, practitioners, youth campaigners, all helping us with this project. People are massively excited about this – people were so excited about the beavers being released in Enfield, they want to see more nature in London.”<\/p> <p>Goldsmith, who has been tasked with looking at viable areas to rewild, said: “The plan is to develop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/15/the-magical-wilderness-farm-raising-cows-among-the-weeds-at-knepp\">Knepp-style<\/a> rewilding projects around the periphery of Greater London in such places as the Dagenham Marshes; at Enfield, where a big nature restoration project is already under way; and in the Colne valley.

I suggested that a rewilding taskforce in London would be a really exciting innovation, not least given London is making strides on all kinds of aspects of the climate agenda.”<\/p> <p>And the mayor immediately signed up. “He was wildly enthusiastic about it,” the conservationist said.<\/p> <p>Goldsmith, who is in the process of rewilding his own estate in Somerset, which currently boasts beavers and wild boar that he says came of their own accord after a suitable habitat was created for them, used his contacts to help create a group of experts who are bringing wildlife back to the capital.<\/p> <p>The group includes the UK’s most famous rewilder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/wilding-isabella-tree-review-farm-return-nature\">Isabella Tree<\/a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/15/the-magical-wilderness-farm-raising-cows-among-the-weeds-at-knepp\">success at Knepp Castle<\/a> has made headlines worldwide.

And skylarks, all that kind of stuff. So, we’d be creating a really wild kind of estuary,” he said.<\/p> <p>And the group is insistent that the rewilding movement will be a community campaign. Rodrigues said: “The point of talking about it as an urban taskforce is it isn’t just a few landowners changing their land – the point of it is we are being told about how excited people are about seeing nature introduced, it is important for health, for flood and climate resilience, it’s something everyone can be involved with.”<\/p> <p>Bruce-White agreed and said the new rewilded areas would be open for the people of London to enjoy. “We want people to connect with and enjoy these places,” he said. “They should be wonderful places to go. If people aren’t connected with nature and connected with their landscapes then we’re all doomed, probably, aren’t we?

Numbers of some butterfly species including the gatekeeper and green-veined white doubled, and birds that usually feed on insects benefited from the shelter provided by hedges and grass margins, including the great tit, up 88%, and blue tit, up 73%.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/22/ben-goldsmith-next-pm-back-plan-farm-subsidies-protect-nature\">Ben Goldsmith: next PM must back plan for farm subsidies to protect nature<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>They also found that overall yields at Hillesden were maintained – and enhanced for some crops – despite the loss of agricultural land for habitat creation. The areas taken out of production were difficult and unproductive to farm, and the other areas benefited from boosted pollinator numbers and pest-eating birds and insects.<\/p> <p>This runs contrary to claims made by many politicians that new post-Brexit agri-environment schemes would be “paying farmers to produce less food” and would damage food security. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor currently running to be prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.fwi.co.uk/news/farm-policy/truss-and-sunak-set-out-their-plans-for-farming\">recently said<\/a> he would “protect” farmers from rewilding their land for nature.<\/p> <p>Jake Fiennes, the head of conservation at the Holkham estate in Norfolk and author of nature-friendly farming book <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/442697/land-healer-by-fiennes-jake/9781785947308\">Land Healer<\/a>, said he was unsurprised by the results of the report.<\/p> <p>He told the Guardian: “Historic policies in England tried to get us to produce food everywhere. But now we are realising that we can increase our average yield by stopping growing food in areas of land that aren’t productive, and in these areas we can make space for nature.

If on the southern edge of that field you have a woodland, invariably the first 15 to 20 metres of that edge won’t produce the average yield, it’ll produce anything up to 50% of average. But when you have all the species that would benefit from that edge of woodland, it’s a no-brainer to give it to nature. This is the poorest land for food production, and when you are not focusing on that area you increase your average yield in the rest of the field.<\/p> <p>“We know we have a biodiversity crisis, we know we have a climate crisis, we know the two are linked, and this is an opportunity to increase our yields as well as providing for nature.”<\/p> <p>Dr John Redhead of the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology and lead author of <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.14246\">the research published in the Journal of Applied Ecology<\/a>, said: “Investigating changes in populations over a significant period of time, and comparing these with other sites, means we can be confident that agri-environment options can bring long-term term benefits for bird and butterfly populations.<\/p> <p>“Hillesden is a typical, large arable farm with conventional agricultural practices, in an ordinary landscape with no large patches of natural habitat. Therefore, it is likely that the results of our long-term study indicate what can be achieved on other commercial farms with good planning, implementation and management of agri-environment measures.”<\/p>","<p>As more towns and cities bring in measures to curb traffic and the number of cars on the streets, the idea of converting parking spaces into “parklets” is gaining traction.

I have green fingers and love gardening so I figured I could turn it into a garden. Then we started getting letters from the council saying you can’t use this space for gardening, it’s for cars. We wanted to create a conversation about use of public space – why, if you are a car owner, can you privatise a public space?<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Wild%20world&amp;description=The%20Guardian%27s%20Age%20of%20Extinction%20series%20reports%20on%20rewilding%20efforts%20around%20the%20world%2C%20as%20the%20idea%20of%20managing%20land%20for%20nature%20gains%20momentum.&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2Fseries%2Fwild-world&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"A link to the rest of the articles in the Wild world series\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Wild%20world&description=The%20Guardian%27s%20Age%20of%20Extinction%20series%20reports%20on%20rewilding%20efforts%20around%20the%20world%2C%20as%20the%20idea%20of%20managing%20land%20for%20nature%20gains%20momentum.&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2Fseries%2Fwild-world&links=false\">Interactive<\/a> <\/figure>  <p>In May 2020, we woke up at 8am and saw a text from a neighbour saying ‘where is your garden?’, and it had just disappeared. My partner put up posters saying ‘missing garden’. Then we discovered the council had come at 5am and taken it away. They took it to the public waste disposal centre (who luckily watered it and took care of it).<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e3173c201d47ec55a9f1e1f0272fbc7044844268\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3173c201d47ec55a9f1e1f0272fbc7044844268/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Couple are photographed from out of a window above them, sitting in front of parklet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schelfhout and her partner, Xavier Damman.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Smets/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>A week later, our neighbours organised a party, and they brought so many flowers we were able to start a new garden. We discovered that if you put your garden on a hand cart it’s allowed to be on the street, which is written in some obscure 150-year-old law. So we got back our old garden, put it on the hand cart and walked it home through the streets of Brussels. We paid a ticket – €28 for the whole year. We haven’t really heard from the council, they can’t do anything any more.<\/p> <p>When I arrived in this neighbourhood I didn’t know anyone, and now we know everybody. I have my garden to thank for that. We need these public spaces to heal society, I strongly believe that. I’m a mum with three teenage boys. I want them to be free in our city and breathe fresh air. That is their right. Our kids love it, but they think their mum is crazy. Our garden is called a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/citizen_garden\">Citizen Garden<\/a> and now there are three more in Brussels, made by people inspired by what we did. We had no idea what this would become – we just wanted a garden.<br><strong>Leen Schelfhout, Brussels<\/strong><\/p> <h2>‘We had an orange tree but someone stole it, so we put a thorny rose there’<\/h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fa435bbfa8e854766725f2981e41b0352b46b3cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa435bbfa8e854766725f2981e41b0352b46b3cf/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Five people (two women, three men) jump in the air in front of container (in foreground) packed with plants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Preston (second right) and colleagues at Egmont Park’ING in Brussels.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Smets/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>We didn’t have authorisation when we created our first parklet in Brussels in 2020, it started as a whim. We were inspired by the Citizen Garden. In this city, there is a car culture so there is congestion everywhere. In the highway code it states that you can’t park five metres after a pedestrian crossing, but in practice cars park in these spaces all the time. My colleagues and I took advantage of that legal grey area and laid down a green mat that demarcated five metres and put a planter on it. Then we planted a bunch of seeds that grew into plants for local bugs. It’s a nice sunny spot. In the end it was only there for three months because cars kept intentionally bumping into it and eventually destroyed it.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"03f73cd75dc3ef8ecfad5885a78ae33c5518cd1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03f73cd75dc3ef8ecfad5885a78ae33c5518cd1a/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of parklet in front of office block.

This time we’re getting a bike rack too, partly to protect the planter but also because we like bikes, and the council has put a concrete block behind it to stop people bumping into it. Now we have strawberries, lavender, thyme, and a bunch of wildflowers growing. We had a nice orange tree but someone stole it, so we put a thorny rose there, which people couldn’t yank out. It’s outside our office and my favourite thing is walking up to the window and looking at people admiring it as they walk past.

We created our parklet two and a half years ago. My wife is chief gardener and I painted it in anticipation of the Queen’s jubilee, to look especially good for the big day. Over the years, I had been lobbying for the council to make parklets, so we can use our streets in a better way. The council started doing some commercial parklets and then a few years ago it opened the scheme up for residents. What is important is having streets with seats, where people can watch the world go by. Rita has planted lots of flowers people can enjoy as they sit there, such as forget-me-not, verbena, geranium, agapanthus and honeysuckle.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f2cd33f0c4b4905ca1943c34a0b37f19aca50eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f2cd33f0c4b4905ca1943c34a0b37f19aca50eb/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sign on back of chair reads ‘Princess May Road community parklet’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The parklet signage was made to match the typeface used for local street names.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urszula Soltys/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>I paid for a sign identical to the typeface of the council’s street name plates (which I originally helped design).

Some people stop and have a cigarette after a night out. Apparently a guy with a guitar did a little concert the other day. Workmen often come up to me and say they really like it because it gives them somewhere to sit and eat their sandwiches. Anybody and everybody. My surprise has been how easy it’s been – cigarette butts are the worst thing we’ve had to contend with.

The house had two parking bays. My wife’s got green fingers and I’ve got “fish fingers” – I used to be a marine biologist. This is a seaside town steeped in history, with piracy, trade and invasions, so to have the nautical theme seemed like an obvious move. I joined the local Facebook group and posted: ‘Hey we’re looking for a boat we’d like to fill with dirt and flowers to put on our parking spot.’ <\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"824810113611da3f2c495dbca7a98888f4038ac7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/824810113611da3f2c495dbca7a98888f4038ac7/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boat is painted yellow and has letters missing on side, so that name now reads ‘Old’ (not ‘Golden’)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winn’s parklet boat was a donation in response to an appeal on his local Facebook page.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Someone offered an old boat called the Golden Tulip.

The carpenter down the street said we should build a dock, so I brought cleats and tied it to the dock – if it rains a lot you don’t want it floating away! Now I want to get driftwood, lobster pots – over the years it’s going to turn into something ridiculous. All our neighbours have been really supportive, and people have started thinking about putting plants on their front parking spots. We’ve got echium, delphiniums, erysimums, scabious and foxgloves – which the insects love.

We asked the council to set up a scheme so that instead of a parking permit, you would get a permit for a parklet. That was over three years ago and for whatever reason it couldn’t be achieved. So three or four of us got together and started building planters from two large pallets. On a street of around 150 flats and houses, there were probably five complaints. Then the council started issuing notices saying the planters had to be removed. We’ve had periodic tussles about it. One of my neighbours said, ‘if you don’t like the city go live in the countryside’. Initially we had a lot of vandalism. We had a policy that as soon as it happened we fixed it. Some cars drove into it deliberately. But then people decided it wasn’t so bad after all.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c430d942f0b44807a295bc72d8f98e3c258f9072\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c430d942f0b44807a295bc72d8f98e3c258f9072/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up shot of nasturtiums and red campion in the parklet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nasturtiums and red campion in the parklet.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urszula Soltys/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Now, instead of a car we’ve got frogs and a colony of ladybirds.

I really love that. When we have spiders spinning their webs in the autumn you can hear children shouting and laughing.<\/p> <p>We try to prioritise pollen-rich plants such as birdsfoot trefoil, rosemary, lavender, campion, foxglove, cosmos, nigella, as well as edible things like red chard and parsley.

It’s an area that has a lot of illegal dumping of rubbish and a lack of green spaces – there is about one tree for every 300 people here. I live in a cul-de-sac, off an industrial side road near a school, and one of the main reasons we made the garden was to send the message that this is our community and it’s taken care of. We named it Kellie’s garden after the boxer Kellie Harrington, who grew up in this part of town. She won gold in August last year, when we made it, and it resembles a boxing ring – square with a trellis on the back wall.

People have been living on this street for 90-odd years, they knew nothing had been there, although cars randomly parked there. It took three months to complete; the plot is 2.5 by 5.5 metres and we were awarded €2,500 from <a href=\"https://www.irelandfunds.org/\">the Ireland Funds<\/a>. Everyone got together and did lots of different tasks. The goal was to get flowering perennials. It’s quite a shady spot so it will be challenging to see what grows – we’ve got foxgloves, campanula, jasmine, lavender and three cherry trees, which have just gone in with the help of a local builder who lent us his tools to break through the concrete. Everyone is pretty delighted, and it’s a symbol of what our community can do together – it’s so nice to see things grown rather than freshly dumped rubbish. One of the great things is that everybody knows each other better.

Ideologically, we wanted to create a space that would be alive and beautiful. Selfishly we wanted to have space to grow food, and to enjoy. Originally we did add a load of muck and biochar, but mostly we’ve added the composted grass from a neighbouring housing estate, which the contractors dumped. It rots down to lovely stuff with loads of worms. The hardest thing is how public it has been. Over lockdown I worked in a room above the garden and would hear people discussing it. Some people said ‘what a mess!’. Some people really loved seeing the pumpkins. We did a pond and I’m hoping that our resident frogs will eat the slugs and snails. We’re growing all kinds of things – potatoes, onions, carrots, beans, rocket, sunflowers, chives, chard … loads of stuff. And it’s only 4 by 4 metres. It’s full and glorious.<\/p> <p>When I’m working in it, loads of people stop and talk. They like reminiscing about eating homegrown vegetables when they were young. People love giving advice, most of it brilliant, some of it a bit loopy. This year, I’ve had a couple of blackbirds that have been a total pain. They’ve really liked the worms and in digging for them have pulled up potatoes and all the young carrots. Someone has just offered us 90 Victoria plum trees! I want people who walk past to be able to graze on it – I imagine people eating apples, raspberries and currants from the pavement.

From releasing apex predators&nbsp;such as&nbsp;jaguars and wolves to making space for native grasslands in urban areas, rewilding can happen on a big or small scale. <br>While there are competing definitions, most have the rebuilding of sustainable ecological health at their core,&nbsp;be it the return of kelp forests on the Sussex coast in England or the reintroduction of mockingbirds on the Galápagos Islands.<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Why has the term become so popular?<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>Rewilding has captured the public's imagination&nbsp;by being an environmental movement and a science-based process at the same time. With visions of a wilder planet, high<b>-<\/b>profile environmentalists&nbsp;such as&nbsp;David Attenborough and George Monbiot inspired millions with paths to a more biodiverse, ecologically healthy&nbsp;future. The success of rewilding pioneers around the world has shown what is possible: from the restoration&nbsp;of Gorongosa national park in Mozambique after the civil war to the Knepp estate in the south of England.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Does rewilding have universal support? <\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>No. Critics of rewilding fear that the term is being used to justify the removal of humans from&nbsp;the&nbsp;landscape, especially farmers and indigenous communities. In the UK, some have dismissed the concept as a fad for&nbsp;'toffs'&nbsp;and landowners with vast incomes, while others fear it&nbsp;is&nbsp;being used to attack agricultural&nbsp;communities who have farmed areas for hundreds of years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Can you rewild? <\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>While the boldest rewilding initiatives take place at a landscape scale, small changes can have a big impact. Millions of people changing how they mow their grass or let nature into their gardens, balconies and window sills can add up, providing more space for biodiversity to recover.&nbsp;<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n   <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n <\/gu-atom> \n<\/figure> \n<p>Created in 2020, the <a href=\"https://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/rewilding-projects/dayshul-brake\">Dayshul Brake cluster<\/a> covers 148 hectares and includes all of Green and Engi’s land, and 13 hectares of Walker’s, focusing on his river habitats, woodland and scrubland. The different approaches of these three landowners, united by their desire to have more nature in their valley, is key to their success. Walker has beautiful wildflower meadows and river habitats, which he manages with grazing livestock; Green provides the woodland; and Engi – with the help of her daughter Eti Meacock – is encouraging the land to make its own journey into wilderness.<\/p> \n<p>They have dug up drains, created dozens of ponds and shared wildflower seeds and advisers.

Not having a plan is important because it leaves “space to be surprised by the land”. She has put camera traps around the farm so she can keep an eye on animal antics. The beaver material is worthy of <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/youvebeenframed\">You’ve Been Framed<\/a>, she says.<\/p> \n<p>She has also bought a drone, and there are canoes by the lake.

Although there is talk of financially supporting landowners to make such changes, the funding has not yet been rolled out. “We’re constantly looking for grants. Ideally you would be paid for creating a wetland, but at the moment I am supporting the state to do what it should be funding people to do,” says Engi.<\/p> \n<p>They have given themselves five years of creative destruction to build up biodiversity while getting limited income from the land from the basic payment system (soon to be abolished in the UK), hay sales and barn rentals. Engi sold her house in London and bought the farm as a partnership with her daughter, and her son, Anthony. She still works part-time as a psychotherapist.<\/p> \n<h2><strong>Meticulous design<\/strong><\/h2> \n<p>Elsewhere in the cluster, Walker is meticulously redesigning the ancient <a href=\"https://www.essebeare.farm/\">Essebeare farm<\/a>, which is listed in the Domesday Book. It sits on <a href=\"https://www.devonwildlifetrust.org/sites/default/files/2018-01/Culm_brochure_17-11-14.pdf\">culm grassland meadow<\/a>, only fragments of which remain; looking after it involves very specific management.<\/p> \n<p>Walker took over the 90-hectare family farm eight years ago when he was in his mid-30s, and has been methodically improving it ever since. “I’m connecting with the memory of this land, what it is, and what it wants to be,” he says.<\/p> \n<p>His pride is his old grasslands full of knapweed, bird’s-foot trefoil, common cat’s ear, burnet-saxifrage and many vetches. The land has escaped the influence of agricultural intensification visible in the surrounding valley, probably because it is so steep. Just 100 years ago, these would have been common plants, and now Walker is encouraging other landowners to revive this rare and precious habitat.<\/p> \n<p>Walker, who has four children under 11, has a very specific sense of when farming went wrong: from the 60s to 80s, when half of all hedgerows were ripped out. “Rather than rewilding, we’re rewinding 100 years. I like to call it ‘the great rewinding’”. He even has the same traditional ruby cattle that were on the land 500 years ago.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"33a9372905fb1d50e760ead8800bf19642b14b53\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33a9372905fb1d50e760ead8800bf19642b14b53/0_275_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver and Rachel Walker with their children Arthur, 5, Emeline, 9, and Reuben, 2, on Essebeare farm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver and Rachel Walker with three of their children, Arthur, 5, Emeline, 9, and Reuben, 2, on Essebeare farm.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>He is registered with the <a href=\"https://www.pastureforlife.org/\">Pasture For Life<\/a> scheme, and has been focusing on creating <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/our-work-in-scotland/scotland-farming-programmes/mob-grazing/what-is-mob-grazing/\">“mob grazing” systems<\/a>. This involves restoring thousands of metres of hedges and old earth banks, and planting more than 12,000 hedge trees, including wild pear, cherry and apple. This all makes for a well-stocked larder for wildlife. In one afternoon late last summer, he counted 60 skylarks over one field.<\/p> \n<p>Much of this has been possible thanks to a £125,000 capital works grant. “You don’t have to be intensive to be successful,” he says.<\/p> \n<p>Each year, Walker makes £30,000-£40,000 from livestock sales and gets a similar amount from the basic payment and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/environmental-stewardship\">higher level stewardship<\/a> grant.

In summer, it is stuffed with orchids.<\/p> \n<p>She gives me a (modestly delivered) masterclass on wildlife-friendly woodland management. Brambles have been allowed to flourish between trees. She counted 18 species of butterflies last year, hares scamper across the woodland and dormice nest in the trees.

Farming leaders have argued that rising food prices mean more effort should be devoted to producing food, rather than rewilding or other environmental schemes.<\/p> <p>Goldsmith said this was a false choice, as ELMs could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/03/the-regenerative-farm-working-to-improve-soil-without-fertilisers\">exist alongside<\/a> increasing and more efficient food production, if less food was wasted and less land devoted to feeding livestock. “The idea that we can’t create streaks and patches of wildness in this country is folly.”<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af70d9ddcfb9ef349425a105c7c33fa7b1942788\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af70d9ddcfb9ef349425a105c7c33fa7b1942788/73_231_2818_1691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Goldsmith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Goldsmith: ‘The principal problem is a psychological one, about our need to control nature.

However, there are still fears the new prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/15/uk-net-zero-goal-tory-leadership-race\">could weaken green policies<\/a> or fail to give them the boost needed to achieve the government’s targets.<\/p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/08/green-tories-fear-lurch-away-from-progress-on-climate-after-johnson\">backer of Johnson<\/a>, Goldsmith said he was resigning from his current post as non-executive director of Defra, though not in protest.<\/p> <p>He has held the position for nearly five years, overseeing a period of intense change including three major new pieces of legislation – the Environment Act, Agriculture Act and Fisheries Act – and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/16/food-security-brexit-biggest-shake-uk-farming-40-years-agriculture-bill\">biggest shake-up of farm policy<\/a> in 40 years. His term was due to end within six months but he said he had decided to go early to ease the transition to a successor and to pursue his interests in rewilding.<\/p> <p>Johnson, according to Goldsmith, was a champion of environmental issues. “For all his faults, he has a sense of the sacred. He grew up on Exmoor, he sees the beauty of nature and recognises the importance of nature, it comes naturally to him.”<\/p> <p>The next Tory leader would face an electoral backlash if they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/08/ranked-how-green-are-the-tory-leadership-candidates\">scrapped Johnson’s green policies<\/a>, Goldsmith said, as opinion polls show people support action on the environment. “It would be foolhardy to roll back the [green] policies of this government. There is a growing understanding in this country that we live in one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth. It’s very important to remain active on this.”<\/p> <p>Truss and Sunak brought forward policies beneficial to the environment while in cabinet, according to Goldsmith. As chancellor, Sunak set up the £750m nature for climate fund, while Truss as foreign secretary oversaw an expansion of overseas development aid for climate and nature recovery. “Sunak’s record on nature is not bad. Whether he individually gets it, I’m not sure, but I’m optimistic based on his record as chancellor. With Liz Truss, all the big nature policies have taken place since her time [as secretary of state] at Defra, but as foreign secretary has dramatically ramped up the international recovery of nature.”<\/p> <p>But while he refuses to be drawn on which he would prefer as prime minister – “I don’t know enough to vouch for either of them” – Goldsmith is vitriolic on the potential appointment of Mark Spencer, the leader of the Commons and former chief whip, as Defra secretary of state if Sunak wins. “He would be a terrifying prospect. That would be a disaster.”<\/p> <p>Instead, Goldsmith hopes the current environment secretary – George Eustice, whom he credits along with predecessor Michael Gove with the successful steering of major environmental legislation and policy change in the five years of his board membership at Defra – remains in post.<\/p> <p>Goldsmith, son of the financier and Eurosceptic UK Referendum party founder, Sir James Goldsmith, said the ELM changes were a benefit of Brexit. “Under the old system [the EU’s common agricultural policy], taxpayers paid rich landowners based solely on how much land they farmed … The richer you are, the more money you get from taxpayers. How can you justify that?”<\/p> <p>If ELMs are successful, Goldsmith believes private sector companies will also offer farmers money for the environmental goods and services they provide. For instance, water companies and flood insurers could pay farmers to maintain water catchment areas and keep waterways in good condition, and farmers could also be paid for storing carbon.<\/p> <p>Goldsmith plans to use similar deals with private companies to prove rewilding can be a commercial success as well as an environmental one, with projects in partnership with Charlie Burrell of Knepp, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/26/knepp-estate-why-the-king-and-queen-of-rewilding-are-farming-again-after-20-years-aoe\">the country estate in West Sussex<\/a> that turned from farming to rewilding.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"><\/iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>He said rewilding could provide access to nature for city dwellers, improving health and wellbeing. “Something has shifted in society since the lockdowns, that demand for the natural world. [Rewilding can] help people reconnect at a visceral level with nature.”<\/p> <p>Too much of British people’s attitude towards nature in the past had been one of “control and domination”, he said. Pointing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/20/experts-call-for-stop-to-badger-cull-as-link-to-bovine-tb-is-contested\">badger culling<\/a> and opposition to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/21/beavers-to-be-given-legal-protection-in-england\">reintroduction of beavers<\/a>, he added: “The first thing many people do is reach for a gun.”<\/p> <p>When it comes to rewilding, people need to be helped to see the benefits, he believes. “The principal problem is a psychological one, about our need to control nature. We need to let it go, to allow nature recovery,” he said. “There is this fear that [if we rewild] we will starve, or those who don’t starve will be eaten by wolves. But the idea that you can’t make room for nature in our landscapes is absurd.”<\/p>","<p>When the Chelsea flower show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/24/beaver-themed-rewilding-garden-wins-chelsea-flower-show-top-prize\">bestowed its top award this year <\/a>on a scruffy patch of wet woodland complete with beaver dam, pool and lodge, it was a symbolic moment. Rewilding may still excite or antagonise but here was a radically new way of managing land for nature being embraced by the mainstream – and by the British establishment.<\/p> \n<p>Five years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/01/rewilding-conservation-ecology-national-trust\">European rewilders were bemused<\/a> by Britain’s debate over whether beavers should be allowed back on to rivers. Today, hundreds, possibly thousands, of beavers are at large – and legal – across the country. Where one English landowner, the Knepp estate in Sussex, first trod the lonely path to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/15/the-magical-wilderness-farm-raising-cows-among-the-weeds-at-knepp\">abandon conventional farming <\/a>for free-ranging herbivores and allowing more natural processes to unfurl, <a href=\"https://rewildingbritain.org.uk/rewilding-network\">scores of landowners<\/a> of all sizes are now following.<\/p> \n<p>Familiar debates over the value of rewilding still rage but the British iteration seems to have eschewed talk of reviving wolves and lynx to cross new frontiers. Rewilding’s terrain is changing, most dramatically with the arrival of private finance and a new focus on bringing benefits to people – as well as sea-wilding.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"34f81ded-7e3f-47a3-8d82-f05f0fb147ae\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is rewilding?<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>Rewilding is the restoration of nature in places altered by human activity. From releasing apex predators&nbsp;such as&nbsp;jaguars and wolves to making space for native grasslands in urban areas, rewilding can happen on a big or small scale. <br>While there are competing definitions, most have the rebuilding of sustainable ecological health at their core,&nbsp;be it the return of kelp forests on the Sussex coast in England or the reintroduction of mockingbirds on the Galápagos Islands.<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Why has the term become so popular?<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>Rewilding has captured the public's imagination&nbsp;by being an environmental movement and a science-based process at the same time. With visions of a wilder planet, high<b>-<\/b>profile environmentalists&nbsp;such as&nbsp;David Attenborough and George Monbiot inspired millions with paths to a more biodiverse, ecologically healthy&nbsp;future. The success of rewilding pioneers around the world has shown what is possible: from the restoration&nbsp;of Gorongosa national park in Mozambique after the civil war to the Knepp estate in the south of England.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Does rewilding have universal support? <\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>No. Critics of rewilding fear that the term is being used to justify the removal of humans from&nbsp;the&nbsp;landscape, especially farmers and indigenous communities. In the UK, some have dismissed the concept as a fad for&nbsp;'toffs'&nbsp;and landowners with vast incomes, while others fear it&nbsp;is&nbsp;being used to attack agricultural&nbsp;communities who have farmed areas for hundreds of years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Can you rewild? <\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>While the boldest rewilding initiatives take place at a landscape scale, small changes can have a big impact. Millions of people changing how they mow their grass or let nature into their gardens, balconies and window sills can add up, providing more space for biodiversity to recover.&nbsp;<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n   <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n <\/gu-atom> \n<\/figure> \n<p>Rebecca Wrigley, chief executive of Rewilding Britain, the charity established <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/16/britain-wild-nature-rewilding-ecosystems-heal-lives\">with the support of George Monbiot<\/a> in 2015 after his book, Feral, galvanised British rewilding, recently found herself at a House of Lords dinner for nature-based solutions to the country’s legally binding net zero and nature recovery targets, alongside asset managers and investment funds. Suddenly, big money is eager to invest in rewilding with hitherto unprofitable land now seen as valuable in an era of carbon credits and laws requiring new developments to bring about “biodiversity net gain”, and ensure no additional nutrients are added to rivers in certain English catchments.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbc9003358953ae863f6590a2487078a0c421c75\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbc9003358953ae863f6590a2487078a0c421c75/0_0_5908_3943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Knepp rewilding project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Knepp estate in Sussex, an early adopter of rewilding.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Cullen/The Guardian<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>“In some senses it’s like the wild west,” says Wrigley. “There are very few brokers for the money that’s interested in investing in biodiversity and carbon, and the providers of that land.

Yes, we want to see large-scale restoration of naturally functioning ecosystems and natural processes but we also want to see communities play a real part in that. We see people very much as part of nature. Otherwise it’s another massive corporate land-grab.”<\/p> \n<p>These comments reveal another new frontier for British rewilding – one that was much less visible five years ago: instead of discussing wolves and bears, today’s rewilders are quick to emphasise people and prosperity. This might be dismissed as rhetoric were it not for new facts on the ground.<\/p> \n<p>A Rewilding Britain study of 32 projects in England found they brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/29/forget-fine-art-investors-urged-to-put-their-money-into-rewilding\">a 54% increase in jobs<\/a>.

There are a lot more land management jobs in rewilding before nature can take over. Once it does, regenerative businesses can develop.”<\/p> \n<p>Community-led rewilding is also under way, most notably at Langholm, a small town in southern Scotland where local charity the <a href=\"https://www.langholminitiative.org.uk/\">Langholm Initiative<\/a> has sought to regenerate the former textiles town since the 1990s, successfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/02/scottish-village-langholm-moor-duke-of-buccleuch\">raising £3.8m in just six months<\/a> to buy 2,100 hectares (5,200 acres) of moorland and valley from the Buccleuch estate in 2021. Now the community has been awarded £1m by the Scottish Land Fund, taking them a step closer to meeting their goal of raising £2.2m by the end of July to buy another 2,140 hectares (5,300 acres). “It’s incredibly exciting,” says Jenny Barlow, estate manager for the Langholm Initiative. “We’re really hopeful we’ll get it over the line but it will be a tense few weeks.<\/p> \n<p>“As well as restoring the land for nature and climate, there will also be a really big benefit for the town and the people who live here,” says Barlow. She tends to talk about restoration but says she has no hangups about the “rewilding” word. “It’s just easier to explain that we’re putting the building blocks of nature back in the landscape. It’s very transparent and very clear what we’re trying to do,” she says.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"337866eb0e76d50fb2b70157bd4add1694342365\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/337866eb0e76d50fb2b70157bd4add1694342365/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A golden eagle in Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A golden eagle in Scotland.

Stage one for Langholm is to develop a five-year plan with the community. The ecological idea is to restore blanket bog, allow valley-bottom woodland to recover, and create a mosaic with free-roaming grazing animals to help retain patches of open moorland for the local star species, the hen harrier. “We’re starting to get golden eagles visiting the valley and other species returning,” says Barlow.<\/p> \n<p>But the key is economic sustainability. “If we don’t get that right we can’t get the rest,” she says.<\/p> \n<p>As rewilding projects multiply, not all of them can be sustained by glamping but Langholm’s proximity to the Lake District should ensure successful ecotourism. “Local businesses are really excited to see an increase in people coming here but we need to make sure it’s sustainable, ethical and people are paid well,” says Barlow. Langholm is starting a community-run tree nursery, looking at renewable energy, as well as some commercial forestry. Sustainable carbon credits will help too. Most important, the land is a boon for outdoor education. “We’re getting all the local kids out so they will grow up and say, ‘this is ours’,” says Barlow. “Success will be when these children are leaving school and see loads of different economic opportunities for them through this land.”<\/p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We’d love to give communities a place where they can grow food, we want forest gardens and no-dig allotments<\/p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Jan Stannard, Heal Rewilding<\/cite> \n  <\/footer> \n <\/blockquote> \n<\/aside> \n<p>Another way to link people with similar projects is being pioneered by <a href=\"https://www.healrewilding.org.uk/\">Heal Rewilding<\/a>, a charity offering the landless majority in England a chance to buy a stake in rewilded land with an ingenious fundraising model based on individuals purchasing <a href=\"https://www.healrewilding.org.uk/heal3x3\">3 metre by 3 metre squares<\/a>.

How do we get sea wilding to happen politically? It’s on the agenda. It’s just that there are very deep concerns about livelihoods. I’d argue these livelihoods are residual and if we want more jobs we need to give the seas a chance to recover.”<\/p> \n<p>Once again, rewilders’ best hope for sea-wilding may lie with communities. When islanders on Arran successfully established Britain’s first community-led no-take zone at Lamlash Bay in 2008, rewilding wasn’t in their vocabulary. “We can see the no-take zone as a form of marine rewilding but it’s not excluding people – it’s helping them benefit from a healthy marine ecosystem,” says Jenny Crockett of the <a href=\"https://www.arrancoast.com/\">Community of Arran Seabed Trust<\/a> (Coast). “If you let nature be nature, it’s amazing what can reappear and that’s what’s happening in Lamlash Bay.”<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5fc3ccb5998cd82cf01d7e25f7903fc46fd1729\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5fc3ccb5998cd82cf01d7e25f7903fc46fd1729/4_6_1281_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juvenile queen scallops at Lamlash Bay, Arran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juvenile queen scallops set up home on kelp fronds in the no-take zone at Lamlash Bay, Arran.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Howard Wood/University of York<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>These waters were described as a marine desert, decimated by years of trawling and scallop dredging, but the no-take zone has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/25/how-no-take-zones-revived-one-devastated-scottish-fishery-isle-of-arran\">proved to be a nursery for juvenile fish<\/a>, home to four times more lobsters than in surrounding areas and with four times higher king scallop density. There’s also a “spillover” effect as local fishers catch larger lobsters in the surrounding waters. “That’s when the fishermen start to benefit, because these larger, healthier animals are spilling over to areas where they are allowed to be caught and there are still enough in the no-take zone to be seeding future stocks,” says Crockett.

Supporters of rewilding say the two can co-exist, but that farming has to change given it is the <a href=\"https://research.senedd.wales/research-articles/the-state-of-nature-2019-report-17-of-species-in-wales-are-at-risk-of-extinction/\">biggest contributor<\/a> to nature loss in the country. <br><br>Around 1 in 6 species in the country are currently at <a href=\"https://research.senedd.wales/research-articles/the-state-of-nature-2019-report-17-of-species-in-wales-are-at-risk-of-extinction/\">risk of extinction<\/a> and birds like turtle doves and corn buntings have already gone from Wales’ skies.<br><br>With close to 90% of land in Wales used for agriculture, there is currently little space for wildlife to exist free from the influence of farming.

Rewilding Britain was forced to step down from the project. Adding to the disquiet are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-58103603\">reports<\/a> of Welsh farmland being bought for carbon-offset projects. <br><br>Fielden, 31, who has just taken over the tenancy of Hafod y Llyn Isaf, a farm a few miles from Wales’ highest mountain, Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), is involved in the nature friendly farming network, but nonetheless remains sceptical of rewilding.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"85c46a58-29a1-49a5-9e77-683ac5b4c1a5\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is rewilding?<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>Rewilding is a movement to restore natural ecological processes to large landscapes – allowing wild land and its inhabitants to develop and change independently of human influence. Popularly, it’s seen as bringing back big carnivores such as wolves, but in Europe there has been more “herbivorous” rewilding, using beavers, hardy Konik horses or wild grazers such as bison to change landscapes. The “re” is redundant: every rewilder accepts there can be no return to yesterday, even if we knew what that was.<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it popular?<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p> Rewilding chimes with people because it is an exciting, ambitious alternative to a century of conventional conservation. Traditional attempts to protect small nature reserves with targeted “management” to help specific rare species has not halted the sixth great extinction rupturing our planet. In Britain, the Guardian columnist George Monbiot helped popularise rewilding with his book Feral.<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Who are the main protagonists – and opponents?<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p> The term was invented by the US conservationist and activist Dave Foreman, a founder of Earth First! The organisation Rewilding Europe was founded in 2011 and Monbiot led the foundation of Rewilding Britain. Mainstream conservation groups such as the National Trust are wary of rewilding while many farmers remain hostile. Critics argue that rewilding seeks to clear 4,000-year-old cultural landscapes of their top architect: human beings.<\/p>\n    <p><br><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n   <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n <\/gu-atom> \n<\/figure> \n<p>“I just find it bizarre.

It’s a weird kind of Highland clearance,” adds Fielden, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Highland-Clearances\">forced removal<\/a> of people from farms in the Scottish Highlands by landlords from the mid-18th century.<\/p> \n<p>Together with her husband, Ned, 29, Fielden is building a herd of sheep and cattle, which they rear outdoors all year round. She has made a beautifully hand-drawn map of their plans for creating flower-rich meadows and integrating the woodland on their farm, once an estuary.<br><br>“Nature can do amazing things, but if we separate ourselves from the land, we will lose that link, as well as the skills and experience of managing it for ever.

Income streams include selling meat boxes, being paid to graze their livestock on other land, and jobs four days a week off the farm.<br><br>It sounds precarious, but Fielden, who grew up in Wrexham, already feels committed to the area and community. “We’re probably going to be here for the rest of our lives,” she says.<br><br>“I’ve always wanted to farm and to do something positive environmentally.

We’re not buying in soya feed like with chickens and there are no external inputs apart from worm treatment.”<br><br>Jane Powell, a coordinator of the Wales Real Food and Farming Conference, and who has been involved in rewilding projects, says farmers are seen by some as “incidental” to the countryside: “That they [farmers] had trashed the wildlife and now someone else was going to restore it.”<\/p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Because we rotationally graze, the organic matter of the soil is improving at 0.2% a year, which means more carbon locked up<\/p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Rhidian Glyn, farmer<\/cite> \n  <\/footer> \n <\/blockquote> \n<\/aside> \n<p>Powell says land-use debates must take account of food, wildlife, tourism and jobs. “Wildlife and food are not two things to be traded off against each other; they need to be integrated.<\/p> \n<p>“We shouldn’t be selling off bits of land for rewilding and keeping intensive poultry production on others,” she says.<\/p> \n<p>Rewilding Britain admits mistakes were made in the mid-Wales project, but insists it is a myth to think rewilding is about abandoning land, food production or communities.<br><br>“Growing numbers of farms are showing how they can make a difference to nature – from smaller-scale wildlife projects that are sowing wildflowers or replanting hedgerows or reducing chemical use, to farms that are rewilding marginal and unproductive land on a large-scale,” says a spokesperson for the organisation.<\/p> \n<p>“Farmers are essential for helping society tackle the nature and climate crises – not least because some 70% of Britain is farmland, and because so often farmers know the land intimately, with deep cultural, historical and personal connections to it.” <\/p> \n<p>While Fielden juggles work, the farm and diversification to stay viable, 50 miles to the south in mid-Wales, Rhidian Glyn has a large enough cattle and sheep business to farm full-time.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9a466833d9d51d359853a9fde5474ad0c58ad8c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9a466833d9d51d359853a9fde5474ad0c58ad8c/0_0_1013_608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rhidian Glyn sits on a quad bike looking from a hilltop with two sheepdogs nearby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rhidian Glyn on his farm north of Machynlleth, Wales, where for every tonne of meat sold from the farm, nine tonnes of carbon are sequestered.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>Glyn, 36, is also a tenant, with a landlord who he is keen to stress wants the land to remain in agricultural use.<br><br>His type of farming – livestock on hilly land – is often seen as the least viable, yet subsidies make up just 10% of his turnover, thanks to booming lamb sales – “prices have gone through the roof since Brexit”, he says – and a profitable business rearing milking cows for local dairy farmers.<br><br>Annual measurements of the farm’s soils show he is capturing and storing, or sequestering, carbon through his cattle and sheep.<\/p> \n<p>“Because we rotationally graze [moving animals between pastures], the organic matter of the soil is improving at a rate of 0.2% a year, which means more carbon locked up in the soils.

Exactly how the rewilded park will look depends on a future public consultation but the process could include the creation of new habitats, such as woodlands, grasslands, scrubland and wetlands (which will provide nesting sites for songbirds), more trees, walking and cycling trails, community orchards and vegetable-growing areas, and the possible reintroduction of such species as water voles, dormice, harvest mice, red kites and red-backed shrikes.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/01/10-great-city-projects-for-nature-from-vertical-forests-to-pocket-farms-aoe\">10 great city projects for nature – from vertical forests to a ‘gangsta garden’<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>Rewilding work, which aims to restore entire ecosystems, often focuses on countryside areas. But rewilding in urban environments is seen by many as key to a better future for people, wildlife and the planet. “Given the biodiversity crisis, the climate emergency and the mounting pressures facing our health service, urban greenspace rewilding should be a top priority for all city authorities,” said Driver. “On a scale such as Allestree, rewilding can make an important contribution to mitigating the impacts of climate change through carbon sequestration, and to soil and water quality through the cessation of chemical and fertiliser applications on the land.”<\/p> <p>Rewilding parts of towns and cities brings direct benefits to the people who live in them, according to Driver. “It’s hugely important to people, as well as wildlife, that we take the opportunity to rewild green spaces in our cities wherever possible,” he said. “There’s enough evidence out there to tell us that nature-rich green space is so much more valuable for health and wellbeing than boring ‘kick-about’ rye grass fields, especially in terms of mental wellbeing.<\/p> <p>“We know that as time passes our population is becoming more urbanised and losing contact with the natural world. Rewilding accessible sites, like Allestree, within city boundaries will help residents re-establish their contact with nature, and increase people’s understanding and respect for our natural environment.”<\/p> <p>Derbyshire Wildlife Trust sees the project as part of a “Natural Health Service”. “Being outdoors makes us feel good,” said Smith. “Hearing birdsong, watching a red kite soar or catching a glimpse of a summer butterfly reduces blood pressure and helps us relax. We need nature as much as it needs us.”<\/p> <p>The ambitious urban rewilding project at Allestree should inspire other councils to follow the lead, said Smith. “Derby city council has taken a bold step at a really important time. Once we show what can be achieved, we can provide a blueprint for other councils to follow.<\/p> <p>“We want to share what we learn and help others take similar steps.

These payments, which will be revealed later this year, should also reach up to £800m a year by 2028.<\/p> <p>George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, said the aim was for wildlife and nature protection to run alongside food production as a matter of course for most farmers. He is expected to tell farmers at the Oxford Farming Conference on Thursday: “We want to see profitable farm businesses producing nutritious food and underpinning a growing rural economy, where nature is recovering and people have better access to it. Through our new schemes, we are going to work with farmers and land managers to halt the decline in species, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, increase woodland, improve water and air quality and create more space for nature.”<\/p> <p>As well as the two new schemes – landscape recovery and local nature recovery – farmers will also be able to apply for payments to help them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/02/farmers-in-england-to-be-paid-for-looking-after-soil-health-from-next-year\">protect their soil<\/a> and take other basic environmental protection measures, under plans announced last year.

The Wildlife Trusts, RSPB and National Trust charities said detail on how the schemes would work was still lacking.<\/p> <p>Craig Bennett, the chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: “The real test of this agricultural transition is not whether it is a little bit better or moderately better than what came before, but whether it will be enough to deliver on [the government’s targets]. Anything less than that means that this historic opportunity will have been wasted. While we’re hearing the right noises from the government, the devil will be in the detail and the detail is still not published nearly six years after the EU referendum.”<\/p> <p>The schemes would fail unless more was done to help farmers move away from intensive practices, said Jo Lewis, the policy and strategy director at the Soil Association. This could include the introduction of ambitious targets for reducing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/06/farms-could-slash-pesticide-use-without-losses-research-reveals\">pesticide<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/28/can-we-ditch-intensive-farming-and-still-feed-the-world\">fertiliser<\/a> use.<\/p> <p>“These schemes won’t work in isolation.

We need these schemes to be bolder and more ambitious, not just delivering more of the same with minor improvements,” he said.<\/p> <p>Tenant farmers, who work on about a third of farmed land in the UK, are concerned over how they can access the new schemes. They also fear that their landlords may <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/28/agriculture-recycling-carbon-farmers-reframe-rewilding-debate\">take advantage of large-scale rewilding<\/a> to remove their tenancies.<\/p> <p>George Dunn, of the Tenant Farmers Association, said: “It is alarming that, after at least three years of discussions with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, it has no clear plan for access to these schemes by tenant farmers. [Current payments] are being removed while we have a vague commitment for further work to be undertaken on how tenants, and those who use common land, can access schemes. It does feel like we are pushing water uphill.”<\/p> <p>Mark Tufnell, the president of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents 28,000 farmers, landowners and rural businesses, said: “The government must also ensure that policy changes look towards domestic food production and security. Britain is already at the forefront of agricultural innovation and animal welfare standards, and we must do more to make certain that our great produce is supported here and abroad. We need to guarantee that profitable agriculture remains a core part of the rural economy and feeds the nation sustainably.”<\/p>","<p>The duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, two of the royal family’s largest portfolios of land, have snubbed tree campaigners who are calling for the royals to rewild their estates.<\/p> <p>Rewilding advocates at the campaign group Wild Card have been meeting for months with the crown estate, which manages most of the royal land and pays the revenue into the Treasury. They say relations have been “really positive”.<\/p> <p>However, the duchies are separate to the crown estate, and not subject to the same level of accountability. The two organisations – described by the land campaigner Guy Shrubsole as “medieval anachronisms” – manage more than 73,000 hectares (180,000 acres) of royal land between them, with all profit going directly to the royal purse.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/30/queens-jubilee-tree-planting-sponsors-linked-to-deforestation\">Queen’s jubilee tree planting sponsors ‘linked to deforestation’<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>Both estates have lower levels of tree cover than the national average.

The average in the UK is 16%, while in Europe it is 38%.<\/p> <p>But neither have responded to repeated requests from Wild Card for a meeting about afforestation, and sources say they have ruled out ever meeting the rewilders.<\/p> <p>“The duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster have categorically ruled out meeting with our campaign. This is an appallingly undemocratic affront to our futures,” said Emma Smart, campaigns manager for Wild Card, which has highlighted the lack of forest cover on royal land.<\/p> <p>The group has delivered a 100,000-signature petition and emailed the duchies on nine occasions, but has had no response.<\/p> <p>Wild Card is asking the royals to practise what they have preached during the Queen’s jubilee tree-planting scheme and allow more trees to grow on their own land.<\/p> <p>Across the country, people have been asked to “plant a tree for the jubilee” to mark the Queen’s 70-year reign. The Queen’s Green Canopy scheme will dedicate a network of 70 ancient woodlands across the UK, and identify 70 ancient trees to “celebrate Her Majesty’s 70 years of service”.<\/p> <p>Joel Scott-Halkes, a co-founder of Wild Card, said: “Given that the ancient medieval duchies are exempt from freedom of information requests and corporation tax, it is sadly little surprise that they consider it beneath them to engage with a democratic people’s led campaign. If they don’t rewild soon, it would be understandable if people proposed their abolition.”<\/p> <p>Royal land is broken up into the crown estate, which is roughly 116,000 hectares, the duchies, which between them are just under 75,000 hectares, and some other smaller holdings.<\/p> <p>The crown estate belongs to the reigning monarch “in right of the crown” – it is owned by the monarch for the duration of their reign by virtue of their accession to the throne. It is not the monarch’s private property, and they cannot sell it – all profits go directly to the Treasury, which then passes a portion back to the crown.<\/p> <p>Unlike the duchies, representatives from the crown estate have been responsive to Wild Card. Hazel Draper, the communications coordinator at Wild Card, said: “We’ve had several positive meetings with the crown estate and things are looking really positive. They’re clearly keenly aware of the urgency of the climate and ecological emergency, and we believe a nature restoration commitment may soon be on the horizon.”<\/p> <p>The duchy of Lancaster owns about 2,020 hectares (5,000 acres) of grouse moors on the North York Moors and about 180 hectares (450 acres) of grouse moors in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire. Campaigners have said much of this land lies on peat bogs, which should be allowed to grow wild to sequester carbon instead of being used for grouse shooting.<\/p> <p>The duchy of Lancaster comprises almost 18,500 hectares and made £20m in profit in 2018. The duchy of Cornwall has 54,632 hectares, nearly double its size in the Victorian period.

Let’s put it into our own landscapes,” he said.<\/p> <p>Critics of rewilding say it removes food production as well as rural jobs – and traditional farmers – from the land. However, Real Wild Estates said it would be targeting “marginal” land that produced little food, and a key part of its business model was to provide more rural employment.<\/p> <p>According to the charity <a href=\"https://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/\">Rewilding Britain<\/a>, there has been a 54% increase in jobs on 32 estates in England that have embraced rewilding, with new roles including safari guides and hybrid ecologist-stock managers to look after free-roaming pigs, cattle and horses and the wider landscape.<\/p> <p>The 1416.4 hectare (3,500 acre) <a href=\"https://knepp.co.uk/home\">Knepp estate<\/a> in West Sussex employed 23 people as a conventional farm, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/15/the-magical-wilderness-farm-raising-cows-among-the-weeds-at-knepp\">after being rewilded<\/a> it has a staff of 47, with a further 200 people employed in companies that rent its converted farm buildings.

Europe’s two largest predators, bears and wolves, appear frequently in folklore and fairytales. Yet the third largest predator, the lynx, is missing.<\/p> <p>This is because they are solitary, shy creatures that ambush their prey, unlike wolves, which hunt in packs.

Britain’s lynxes disappeared because of habitat loss and persecution by humans and many think we have a moral obligation to correct that.

They have naturally recolonised territories in Scandinavia, the Baltic states, western Russia and the Carpathian mountains thanks to acceptance by local people, an increase in forest cover and growing populations of deer (their main food source).<\/p> <p>In central and western Europe, landscapes are more fragmented and heavily farmed, crisscrossed with roads and urban areas that have hindered natural recolonisation by the lynx. Recognising this, conservationists started reintroductions in the 1970s, establishing populations in Switzerland, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and France. The lynxes then naturally spread into Italy, Austria, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Reintroducing lynxes is less problematic than reintroducing wolves because they do not hunt in packs and like to stay hidden in woodland.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/04/its-going-to-be-our-way-now-the-guerrilla-rewilder-shaking-up-british-farming-aoe\">'It’s going to be our way now': the guerrilla rewilder shaking up British farming<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>Projects in Germany and Austria failed mainly because of illegal hunting, which remains a problem, even in countries that have successfully reintroduced the lynx.<\/p> <h2>What is the argument for reintroducing lynxes to the UK?<\/h2> <p>One way lynxes enrich forest ecosystems is by increasing the availability of carcasses. They mainly hunt deer but they cannot eat a whole animal in one go. They eat a bit and then hide it, often burying it under leaves or snow. It can take up to a week to eat the entire carcass.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, wolves, wolverines, bears, foxes, badgers, pine martens, polecats, wild boar and wildcats will feast on it, keeping clear of the lynx usually lurking a few hundred metres away. Raptors such as white-tailed eagles, buzzards and kites also benefit. Research in Poland found that birds and mammals scavenged 80% of carcasses buried by lynxes.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"255ce0f675e2a9099927a05ac17e5810e10cf149\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/255ce0f675e2a9099927a05ac17e5810e10cf149/0_0_6646_4431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lynx successfully hunts a blackbird on Gow’s farm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lynx hunting a blackbird on Gow’s farm.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Turner/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Animals further down the pecking order, such as small woodland mammals and birds, also get a piece of the prize before the remains rot, which in turn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/08/landscape-of-fear-what-the-rotting-carcasses-of-reindeer-taught-scientists-aoe\">enriches ecosystems<\/a> in the soil.<\/p> <p>In Scotland, vast numbers of deer are causing <a href=\"https://www.scotlink.org/publication/faqs-managing-deer-for-climate-communities-and-conservation/#:~:text=High%20deer%20numbers%20are%20causing,removing%20it%20from%20the%20atmosphere.\">widespread ecological damage<\/a>.

Reintroducing lynxes could help reduce deer populations, which would increase natural woodland regeneration.<\/p> <p>But while lynxes are a keystone species, they will not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/23/beavers-native-american-tribes-washington-california\">radically change landscapes as beavers do<\/a>, and would not be suited to living in all parts of the country. They are solitary ambush hunters. Each animal generally has a territory of at least 100 sq km and cats of the same sex do not like to share territories. Landscapes cannot support a high density of them.<\/p> <h2>Why wouldn’t we want lynxes?<\/h2> <p>The lynx’s dietary preferences can get it into trouble – their appetite for sheep is a serious concern for farmers. However, evidence from countries with landscapes similar to the UK suggests that the number of sheep casualties would be relatively small. Sheep in Europe mostly graze in open pasture where lynxes do not generally hunt.<\/p> <p>Switzerland, for example, is home to about 300 lynxes, which kill between 20 and 50 sheep a year, and about 12,500 roe deer and chamois. Licences are given out to kill problematic lynxes, but there have been none issued since 2003. The last lynx killed was from poaching five years ago.<\/p> <p>One country where rates are significantly higher is Norway. This is because as many as <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227793577_Vulnerability_of_Domestic_Sheep_to_Lynx_Depredation_in_Relation_to_Roe_Deer_Density\">2.5 million sheep graze freely in woodlands<\/a> during the summer months and there are relatively few deer, Hetherington found.

All of which would suggest we would have a relationship with lynx that is most likely to replicate what we see in Switzerland.”<\/p> <h2>Where could they be reintroduced in the UK?<\/h2> <p>Lynx UK Trust believes Kielder forest in Northumberland is the most suitable place to reintroduce lynxes because it is a large forested area, has few roads and lots of deer. However, local people are divided over this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/03/plan-to-introduce-lynx-to-kielder-forest-angers-farmers\">contentious issue<\/a> and at the end of 2018 a trial application was turned down by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs after advice from Natural England raised concerns.<\/p> <p>In January, in a separate project, conservationists launched a <a href=\"https://treesforlife.org.uk/about-us/lynx-to-scotland/\">year-long study, Lynx to Scotland<\/a>, to ask farmers, landowners and local communities what they thought about reintroducing lynxes. If they respond positively, a pilot project could be launched, with up to 40 lynx released in five years around forested Highland estates in the Cairngorms.

However, mainly as a result of these deaths and the outrage that followed, it has been <a href=\"https://ijw.org/learning-to-rewild/\">blacklisted by some ecologists<\/a>, who believe its “ecologically and ethically untenable” management has tarnished rewilding’s reputation.<\/p> \n<p>Kuypers says the story was never meant to be about grazing animals, explaining that it was originally a bird reserve, which continues to provide refuge for dozens of rare and declining species. Back in the 1970s, thousands of greylag geese flew over this reclaimed land and set up home. They turned the wetlands into an interesting mosaic of habitats. Other birds arrived too, including spoonbills, egrets and white-tailed eagles, which then spread elsewhere in the Netherlands. At the time, the land had been set aside for industrial development and was in the process of drying out, but an ambitious and influential group of ecologists led by Frans Vera were fascinated by what they were seeing and put forward another plan: to leave it for nature.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"844477e54530cb1975e584e221580bab0fd6e8a9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/844477e54530cb1975e584e221580bab0fd6e8a9/0_906_4480_5814/771.jpg\" alt=\"An older man leaning against a car\" width=\"771\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The idea was that nature could take care of itself on this land, but that’s not true.

He then turned to larger mammals. “We found out that large grazers drive habitat creation and that’s now a cornerstone of rewilding.” By 1983 they had created a nature reserve with animals brought in to kickstart the natural processes.<\/p> \n<p>“Every square inch of land in the Netherlands is disputed,” says Kuypers, so ringfencing this land for rewilding – a totally new way of working with nature – was revolutionary at the time.<\/p> \n<p>Although the birds arrived by themselves, many other animals were brought in and the reserve became like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/12/life-after-big-brother-e4-reality-tv\">Big Brother house<\/a> for nature. Different natural elements were introduced, down to the seeds for reedbeds, which were scattered from a plane. Ecologists wanted to slow the growth of trees in the park so it would remain an open habitat for wetland and grassland birds so they introduced grazing animals.<\/p> \n<p>“Back-bred” animals resembling their extinct relations that would have lived in Europe during the Pleistocene, or ice age, arrived: Konik horses from Polandin 1983; Heck cattle from Germany in 1984; and red deer from Scotland in 1992. They were hardy and fitted in with the carefully cultivated wild aesthetic. This work drove radical changes, pushing traditional conservation towards “nature development” with large herbivores as the “ecological main structure”, which is now common thinking in rewilding.<\/p> \n<p>In 2018, after an outcry over the deaths of so many animals, a committee coordinated by the provincial government called for an end to the policy of allowing “natural processes” to govern herbivore populations, and said numbers must be kept below 1,500. Today a vet comes regularly to check on the animals. Those in bad condition are fed over the winter. When numbers increase too much, they are moved to new areas or killed, and deer and horse carcasses can be sold as “wild meat”.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"440ea2fcd61690fdb14efbfe4a60c78e729045a8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/440ea2fcd61690fdb14efbfe4a60c78e729045a8/0_0_5982_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An emaciated horse \" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An emaciated horse at Oostvaardersplassen in 2018, before the project’s shift in approach.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Utrecht Robin/Action Press/Rex Shutterstock<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>Many lessons have been learned but the rangers working here are still trying to shake off the public image of animals starving to death. “A lot has changed. No animal has died of starvation in three years, yet we’re still seeing these images circulating,” says Kuypers, who has a weekly blog to update people on what is happening at Oostvaardersplassen. “I can’t do anything about it – it’s just one-way communication,” he says about people who troll their work on Twitter. “It really gets under my skin.”<\/p> \n<p>Another impact of having too many herbivores in the landscape is that bird numbers fell. Birds that like tall grasses and scrub such as little grebes, spoonbills and egrets suffered because they had less space to forage. “The idea was that nature could take care of itself on this land, but that’s not true,” says Kuypers. “It was not good for biodiversity.”<\/p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We’re still governed by natural processes as much as possible, but we have enormous impacts as human beings<\/p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Hans-Erik Kuypers, park ranger<\/cite> \n  <\/footer> \n <\/blockquote> \n<\/aside> \n<p>Rangers now intervene in a number of ways. Within the park, land is divided into blocks, each with very different habitats, including mudflats, reeds, wet grassland, dry grassland and woodland. The terrain is shaped by dykes, pumps and water channels, allowing five different water levels on the site. Wetter sections of the reserve are metres higher than drier sections because, like a sponge, they have expanded as they absorbed water.<\/p> \n<p>The park rangers intentionally create dry times and wet times by modifying how much water gets into each section, because “change is good for nature”, helping create a dynamic landscape.<\/p> \n<p>They are currently carrying out a “marshland reset”, which means lowering the water level over a period of three years to encourage new reed growth, which will benefit marshland birds. In the grassland area they are creating wet areas and pools, which will benefit geese, herons and waders. Spoonbills, egrets and little grebes like eating small fish such as sticklebacks, and fish ladders are being constructed to make sure these can reach the reserve. Areas are being fenced off for planting trees. More than a kilometre of ditches has been built to give animals shelter and privacy from humans. <\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab995cbea2b43b0c20a49b08b8f123b0bfb4d6f3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab995cbea2b43b0c20a49b08b8f123b0bfb4d6f3/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A placid river with grass on the nearside and reed beds on the far side\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Land is divided into blocks, each with very different habitats, including mudflats, reeds, wet grassland, dry grassland and woodland.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>“The goals of the area are human goals to biologically make this a richer place.

Instead, he calls it “nature development” – which sounds more interesting in Dutch than in English, he says.<\/p> \n<p>Rewilders have made a real effort to dispel accusations of depopulating landscapes, which is another reason many have distanced themselves from Oostvardesplassen. The vast marshland of the reserve is totally closed off, and the grassland section is only open for a few visitors a day.<\/p> \n<p>“Everything flies away when we come. If you do that 10 times a day, it costs them too much energy. I’m driving around as a guest in nature.

So we’re seeing the next generation coming forward. But those who are 57 have only ever known one system: productivity, and that system paid for them to drain land, to remove hedges and to be more productive by using chemicals. Don’t expect the change overnight. It’s going to be a gradual evolution.”<\/p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Rural communities play a vital role in contributing to our economy, and we know that investment in the natural environment creates rural green jobs.<\/p> <p>“Our green recovery challenge fund is on track to support up to 2,500 jobs in total, with funding for rewilding projects and communities across the country, including those in rural areas.<\/p> <p>“We support the creation and enhancement of wilder landscapes as part of our broader approach to nature recovery, and will continue to back projects that offer both environmental and economic benefits for our communities.”<\/p>","<p>Julia Davies had one only goal in mind when she sold her share of the outdoor equipment company Osprey Europe a few years ago. The entrepreneur decided she was going to spend her millions turning back the clock – by returning swathes of the British farmland to wilderness. Nature is in crisis in the UK, she argues, and its threatened wildlife needs all the protection it can get.<\/p> <p>A few months ago, the first steps towards her rewilding dreams were taken with the purchase of 170 hectares of fields and meadows that surround Court Farm, near Bere Regis, Dorset. The land cost almost £4m but thanks to the prospect of a bridging loan from Davies, Dorset Wildlife Trust has been able to acquire ownership and has begun creating a nature park there.<\/p> <p>Pastures where Friesian cattle once grazed and fields of wheat, maize and barley – which fed the Court Farm herd – will now be returned to nature. New woodland will spread over the pastures, wildlife and plants from hedgerows will colonise fields while a network of deep ditches which have drained the farm for decades will be filled in and blocked. Wetlands will return to the landscape – along with populations of frogs and newts.<\/p> <p>Other new residents will also be enticed to make homes at Court Farm. These could include yellowhammers; silver-washed fritillaries and sand lizards. “Wildlife in this country has been pushed to the margins for too long,” said Davies. “We have been farming far too intensively and badly need to give wild animals and plants a chance to reclaim the countryside.”<\/p> <p>Crucially, the plan adopted by Davies – a commercial lawyer turned green activist – could serve as a template for future rewilding projects as the UK struggles to counter its mounting biodiversity crisis. “Rather than buy my own piece of land to rewild it, I decided to lend money so that conservation groups such as wildlife trusts could get control of a piece of land and raise money, through local appeals, crowdfunding or grants from local councils. Then they could pay me back.”<\/p> <p>The reasoning was straightforward, she added. Once a group like Dorset Wildlife Trust owns a piece of land it becomes far easier for it to raise funds for conservation work. “A charity cannot put in an offer on land until it’s got all its ducks in a row. It has to have funds and trustee approval but often it cannot get trustee approval because they have not got all their funds ready.<\/p> <p>“It’s a circular problem so I decided to find a way to cut through it. I lend money so the charity can buy the land, the charity repays me and then I use that money to fund another project. That way, I get to help rewild a lot more land for my money.”<\/p> <p>In fact, the promise of money from Davies was sufficient for Dorset Wildlife Trust to obtain funds from local authorities, Dorset council and Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole council.<\/p> <p>“The councils supported us because Dorset – like other parts of the UK – is facing a problem caused by the buildup of chemical fertilisers in runoff water,” explained Rob Farrington, who has taken over management of the Court Farm project.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5527e4afc2c226cc3e6aa091d6dd7e52b8a3a2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5527e4afc2c226cc3e6aa091d6dd7e52b8a3a2e/0_100_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists Brian Bleese, Julia Davies and Rob Farrington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists Brian Bleese, Julia Davies and Rob Farrington.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Burland/ Dorset Wildlife Trust<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Swathes of British farmland are regularly sprayed with fertiliser. Rain falls and waters rich in nitrates and other chemicals pour off fields and are carried away, often through sunken ditches dug to keep the land drained and dry. Some of the ditches at Court Farm are more than 3 metres deep. This polluted water then runs into streams, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/21/britains-rivers-suffocating-industrial-farm-waste\" title=\"\">then into rivers <\/a>and finally – in the case of Court Farm – into Poole harbour 15 miles to the east.<\/p> <p>“Combined with runoff from other farms across the county this is now causing real headaches,” added Farrington. “Nitrates have triggered algal blooms across Poole harbour and these are now causing serious ecological damage along dozens of miles of coast in the bay there.”<\/p> <p>As a result, the trust was given more than £3m by the two councils to ensure that nitrate runoff from Court Farm was halted, a move that would help to mitigate Poole harbour’s ecological headaches. This cash – plus money raised from various local legacies – was then used to pay for Court Farm and has left Davies free to begin working with another conservation group in order to rewild a further patch of local farm land, a process she intends to continue over years to come. “The crucial point is that we wouldn’t have got there without the promise of Julia’s money,” added Farrington.<\/p> <p>It is a double boost for ecology. River pollution is reduced while habitats for wildlife are restored, a point emphasised by Brian Bleese, chief executive of Dorset Wildlife Trust. “Wildlife in Britain has been pushed to the margins for too long. More than 70% of UK land is now devoted to agriculture which means most wildlife has been left huddling in the hedgerows. We have bright green pastures all over the country with very little going on within them. We need to change that and get the wildlife out of the hedgerows and back on to the land.”<\/p> <p>In the case of Court Farm its thick hedgerows of oak, elder, blackthorn, hawthorn, ash, dogwood, field maple and other plants criss-cross the land creating a wide, latticed landscape. The undergrowth there provides homes for mammals such as hazel dormice and spiders that include the ferocious looking wasp spider. As wild vegetation spreads, it is hoped these animals and other creatures should slowly move in and make homes in the rewilded landscape.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad02161b9cfdddfe79857f0babcfd051e2b2e74f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad02161b9cfdddfe79857f0babcfd051e2b2e74f/0_176_5315_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The rewilding project aims to provide new habitats for dormice and other species.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The rewilding project aims to provide new habitats for dormice and other species.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagebroker/Alamy<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Emerging wetlands should also provide homes for reeds and attract dragonflies and amphibians such as great-crested newts. “All the species that are crying out for a bit of mess to live in will find this attractive,” said Farrington. “And of course, wetlands hold on to greenhouse gases very well and have a superb carbon footprint.”<\/p> <p>However, the wildlife trust team stress they have no fixed species in mind in rewilding Court Farm. “This is not a typical conservation scheme where you take a precious small remnant of habitat – such as a chalk stream bank or a bit of heathland – and work hard to keep it as it is today in order to preserve a specific endangered animal that still lives there,” said Farrington. “We are simply taking out the high-maintenance aspect of modern farming and waiting to be surprised by what takes over the landscape. In that sense, this is an experiment not just in financing but in conservation.”<\/p> <p>Intriguingly, one of the first tasks involved in preparing these new habitats will be handed to pigs. “They are perfect for grubbing up the ground, breaking open the surface – and that will allow wild plants to take over the fields that have been closely cultivated over the past decades,” said Farrington. “So we are going to borrow a few pigs from a local farm to start off the whole business.”<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/16/rewilding-should-we-bring-the-lynx-back-to-britain-aoe\">Rewilding: should we bring the lynx back to Britain?<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>It will take years to restore wild habitats in this little corner of Dorset but Bleese, Davies and Farrington are confident they can create a resource that will not only help wildlife but will also aid the local community. “It is not the case that people living in the country have open access to the land,” said Bleese. “They are often excluded from large trenches of estates and farms that surround their homes.

We must ensure that the animals released can thrive and survive in the sanctuary and, eventually, the wild.<\/p> <p>“This is the culmination of dedicated conservation work that has spanned almost two decades. It marks the single most significant step towards the survival of the mountain bongo in history.”<\/p> <p>The pristine sanctuary consists of a natural forest that provides an extensive range to continue releasing the mountain bongos in preparation for their survival in the wild. The <a href=\"http://www.kws.go.ke/content/mountain-bongo-recovery-action-plan-2019-2023\">government’s long-term vision<\/a> is to achieve a population of 750 in Kenya by 2050.<\/p> <p>Every year, 10 mountain bongos will be released into the sanctuary in groups of five every six months. It is estimated that by 2025, the sanctuary will have 50 to 70 fully rewilded mountain bongos.<\/p> <p>Tourism and wildlife minister, Najib Balala, said: “The mountain bongo is one of Kenya’s most iconic animals, is critically endangered and can only be found in Kenya. The opening of the sanctuary is a critical step to help achieve [the rewilding process].”<\/p> <p>Weaning the animals from human dependence requires technical skills, patience and commitment to allow the animals to adapt independently. It also requires an appropriate habitat, foliage and enough space to exhibit normal wild animal behaviour.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/29/white-rhinos-flown-from-south-africa-to-rwanda-in-largest-single-translocation\">White rhinos flown from South Africa to Rwanda in largest single translocation<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>According to wildlife experts in Kenya, the long-term success of the release and eventual survival of the animals in the wild largely depends on local communities’ support in surrounding areas, since most of the threats that caused the population decline were human-driven.<\/p> <p>The conservancy is working with these communities to restore degraded areas within Mount Kenya’s forests through a reforestation programme. Under the partnership, the conservancy has involved 3,000 community members in planting more than 35,000 indigenous tree species, with plans to plant another 5,000 trees this year.<\/p> <p>Julius Kamau, chief conservator at Kenya Forest Service, said: “Collaboration is key for the successful protection of any endangered species. We will nurture these vital partnerships to achieve our shared goal of rewilding the rare antelopes, animals that hold great national significance in Kenya.”<\/p> <p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here<\/a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston<\/a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield<\/a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features<\/em><\/p>","<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/13/firm-bring-back-woolly-mammoth-from-extinction\">news that scientists<\/a> are planning to bring back woolly mammoths to the Arctic tundra, by splicing DNA from Asian elephants with that of their extinct ancestors, has raised a few eyebrows in the world of conservation science.<\/p> <p>However, the basic idea of reintroducing large mammals to a vulnerable ecosystem in order to restore and rebalance habitats depleted by our own destructive habits is now widely accepted.<\/p> <p>When we take big, influential creatures out of an ecosystem, we create an imbalance that allows the populations of other species to increase rapidly. For example, because bears, wolves and lynx have long been extinct in Britain, the numbers of native red and roe deer, and the non-native muntjac, have skyrocketed. This creates soil erosion and damage to woodlands and scrub, affecting scarce and specialised species such as the nightingale, and reducing new tree growth.<\/p> <p>In extreme cases, the effects of losing just one keystone species can be disastrous. As Raquel Filgueiras of <a href=\"https://rewildingeurope.com/\">Rewilding Europe<\/a> explains, when they disappear, other species are simply not able to take over their role. As a result, she says, “ecosystems then degrade, and sometimes completely collapse”.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/13/firm-bring-back-woolly-mammoth-from-extinction\">Firm raises $15m to bring back woolly mammoth from extinction<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>The converse is also true. When we put these key species back into a broken ecosystem, we start to restore the balance between predators and prey, and change the composition of the local flora. While species reintroduction is not a magic wand that can solve every problem, it can certainly help reverse losses.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the best-known example is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/25/yellowstone-wolf-project-25th-anniversary\">reintroduction of wolves<\/a> to Yellowstone national park in the US after an absence of almost 70 years. The idea was that the wolves would keep the elk population in check, preventing overgrazing. Ultimately, this would recreate a more diverse and complex habitat, in what scientists call a “trophic cascade”.<\/p> <p>The plan was hugely controversial at the start, but 25 years later it has clearly worked, with Yellowstone having a far richer and better-balanced ecosystem than before. Revenue from wildlife tourism has more than covered the scheme’s costs.<\/p> <p>On a smaller scale, the presence of predatory birds such as goshawks and white-tailed and golden eagles has a similarly beneficial effect by reducing the numbers of medium-sized predators.<\/p> <p>Benedict Macdonald, the <a href=\"http://www.ben-macdonald.co.uk/\">author of the book Rebirding,<\/a> has long championed schemes to restore Britain’s lost or returning wild creatures. In his forthcoming book, Cornerstones, which examines the impact of keystone species, he points out the benefits of the return to the New Forest of one of our most charismatic raptors.<\/p> <p>“Goshawks prey on medium-sized predators such as magpies, jays and crows, which raid songbirds’ nests for eggs and chicks. Keeping their numbers down allows those smaller birds to thrive.” Beneficiaries include red list species such as the hawfinch, mistle thrush and spotted flycatcher, which currently need all the help they can get.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the best-known keystone species is neither a predator nor a huge herbivore, but a rodent. Beavers – rightly known as “nature’s architects” – can transform a wetland ecosystem in a remarkably short time by damming a stream or river, adding levels of complexity. This allows a huge range of species – including the kingfisher, willow tit, otter, water vole, and damselflies and dragonflies – to thrive.<\/p> <p>There is, however, always opposition to these reintroductions, particularly from farmers and landowners. The argument over wolves is perhaps not so surprising, but even beavers have proved to be controversial: some farmers claim the dams lead to flooding in their fields.<\/p> <p>And although it’s a beautiful idea, it’s impossible to know at present exactly what impact the reintroduction of mammoths to the Siberian steppes would have. Would it have the dramatic restorative effect that the project is hoping for? It will be very interesting to find out. <\/p>","<p>With Scotland preparing to host Cop26 in November, and with calls for the country to declare itself the world’s first “Rewilding Nation”, it was heartening to read NatureScot’s chief executive, Francesca Osowska, engage with rewilding in a way that chimes with the positive approach of leading rewilding organisations (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/24/reintroducing-wolves-to-uk-could-hit-rewilding-support-expert-says\">Reintroducing wolves to UK could hit rewilding support, expert says, 24 September<\/a>).<\/p> <p>Yes, rewilding isn’t just about reintroductions. With Scotland one of the world’s most nature-depleted countries, we need large-scale restoration of habitats such as woodlands, peatlands, rivers and seas, alongside opportunities for nature-friendly farming.<\/p> <p>Our newly launched <a href=\"https://rewildingeurope.com/areas/affric-highlands/\">Affric Highlands<\/a> initiative, for example, is bringing together landowners, local communities and others to rewild over <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-58663615\">500,000 acres of the Highlands<\/a>, and so tackle the nature and climate emergencies, while creating social and economic opportunities.<\/p> <p>But Ms Osowska’s focus on the risks of reintroducing bears and wolves is deeply unhelpful. There is no serious campaign to reintroduce bears in Britain. Wolves aren’t returning any time soon. Raising a nonexistent debate in this way risks needlessly frightening rural communities, and undermines constructive conversations about rewilding’s extensive benefits.<\/p> <p>NatureScot also needs to change course on its damaging approach to beaver management. The agency has identified over 100,000 hectares of habitat across Scotland for these natural rewilders, but still prefers to allow problematic beavers to be shot instead of moved to suitable areas.<\/p> <p>Ms Osowska’s comments offer grounds for hope – but also highlight why she needs to engage much more closely with the rewilding sector in Scotland.<br><strong>Steve Micklewright <\/strong><br><em>Chief executive, Trees for Life<\/em><\/p> <p><strong>• <em>Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

These plantations were created in the 1930s, and the wood had a variety of uses, from ships’ masts to trench timbers.

More than 10 sq km of Scots pine has been restructured since 2019. “Here we want twisted, forked trunks, we want the more open-crowned trees,” says Jeremy Roberts, programme manager at Cairngorms Connect, who is showing me around. The woodland is draped in spiderweb lace and the spongy forest floor is spattered in blaeberry, also known as bilberry.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12f4bac3a90e3bd8c8e9eda1e9f0730523f698ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12f4bac3a90e3bd8c8e9eda1e9f0730523f698ab/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Roberts examines the root plate of a Scots pine in an area of restructured forest created by using a winch and ropes to pull down trees, Abernethy Forest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Roberts examines the root plate of a felled Scots pine.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Hamblin/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Large natural forests are affected by storms or have grazing animals moving through them, knocking down trees and creating “storm tracts”, so conservationists are replicating this process by using a winch and ropes to pull the trees down. They are also doing ring barring, which means scraping off a circle of bark a few metres up the trunk. It looks as if a hungry giant beaver has chomped its way through the forest. A tree surgeon even cut the top off one of the trees and now the deadwood is being used by a woodpecker.<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The single most useful thing is expanding the forest, making more forest habitat for capercaillie, and that can happen surprisingly quickly<\/p> <footer> <cite>Jeremy Roberts, Cairngorms Connect<\/cite> <\/footer> <\/blockquote> <\/aside>  <p>These homogenous forests have less than 15% of the deadwood that should be there.

If the key person can’t make a meeting they’re not allowed to send a proxy. “It’s a tight group of people with a lot of trust, which makes it a safe space to challenge and that’s where great collaborative ideas come from,” says Roberts.<\/p> <p>The project had a low-key launch in 2016 because a lot of work was already happening in the respective areas, but things such as deer management work more effectively over a wide area. If you cut deer numbers, creating new forests in places you have existing forests is pretty easy. Seeds from pine forests can be dispersed 150 metres away from the parent plant over moorland and if the density of deer is below four per square kilometre then the pine will regenerate.<\/p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/29/huge-rise-in-scotlands-deer-cull-needed-to-protect-land-says-report\">report from 2020<\/a> estimated that there were up to 1 million wild deer in Scotland, which could be seriously hampering national efforts to increase tree cover. “The priority here is expanding the forests. All the partners are achieving forest expansion by deer control,” says Roberts.<\/p> <p>We walk into the open area leading to Ryvoan bothy, where saplings are sprouting. On one side of the path a<strong> <\/strong>forest of rowan is forming from seeds planted by<strong> <\/strong>wintering thrushes, such as fieldfares and redwings, says Roberts. They feed on berries, then go into the heather to roost, dropping seeds as they go, which grow into saplings.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6c2e6a04ba9c55be32adf993000bd75827d35f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6c2e6a04ba9c55be32adf993000bd75827d35f1/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ecologists examine a moth trap at dawn, Glenmore Forest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ellie Dimambro-Denson, right, and research assistant Max Collins examine a moth trap at dawn in Glenmore forest.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Hamblin/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Next morning, I wake at 5am to do the wildlife equivalent of financial accounting, to see what impact these investments are having on species diversity.

It’s sexy,” he says. <\/p> \n<p>The organisation Rewilding Chile is also working to protect huemul by buying areas of wilderness and private grazing land in Patagonia for restoration and conservation projects. In 2018, it gave 400,000 hectares of rewilded land to the country, collaborating with the government to create a <a href=\"https://www.rutadelosparques.org/en/#\">Route of Parks<\/a>, which today connects a patchwork of 17 national parks, extending 1,700 miles over the southern third of Chile.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd5f4e13829bc30eea1228421600bd3ad8c986aa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd5f4e13829bc30eea1228421600bd3ad8c986aa/0_0_1920_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hidden camera captures one of the rare deer on the slopes of Las Horquetas valley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hidden camera captures a huemul on the slopes of Las Horquetas valley.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Fundación Rewilding Chile<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>The Route of Parks has increased connections between disparate huemul sub-populations but ranching, hunting and construction on private land between these parks still pose a threat to the huemul.

The lead researcher, Carly Vynne, says: “A focused effort on recovering this species would not only help the species itself but could also help complete assemblages across vast areas [of Patagonia].”<\/p> \n<p>Reconnecting the Patagonian pockets the huemul has been reduced to could help restore the depleted in-between landscapes, the study said. The huemul is the only large mammal missing from many Patagonian ecosystems. Saucedo describes huemul as a “sentinel species”, providing intelligence on how a damaged ecosystem is recovering.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"473dfb01a4f93c8d7fdfcf3a7df9ebcfe3bc0691\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/473dfb01a4f93c8d7fdfcf3a7df9ebcfe3bc0691/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A huemul feeds as night falls in Las Horquetas valley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A huemul feeds as night falls in Las Horquetas valley.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Maynard<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>But the huemul continues to face threats, including the climate crisis and a change of land use.

Further fundraising will take place, with members of the new London rewilding roundtable group tasked with sourcing private donations.<\/p> <p>Goldsmith said: “I’m so excited to be working with Sadiq on this new rewilding taskforce for London. All people need to experience close connection with nature in their lives, and yet for many Londoners this is a remote possibility today.<\/p> <p>“From green rooftops to pocket parks, nest boxes for peregrines and swifts, rewiggling streams and reintroducing long lost native species, our plan is to weave wild nature back through the very fabric of our city.”<\/p> <p>There are 1,600 places designated by local authorities as sites of importance for nature conservation, covering 20% of the capital.

It sounds like the start of a joke, though the antics of this unlikely trio have not ended in a punchline but one of the UK’s largest land restoration projects.<\/p> <p>They have been collaborating on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/24/vast-area-of-scottish-highlands-to-be-rewilded-in-ambitious-30-year-project-aoe\">Affric Highlands scheme<\/a>, which covers an array of woodlands, peatlands, montane, river and coastal habitats between the west coast of Scotland and Loch Ness. The aim of the project, announced this week, is to rewild half a million acres (200,000 hectares) of land – by rewilding the people who live in it.<\/p> <p>Conservation manager Alan McDonnell, who works for the rewilding charity <a href=\"https://treesforlife.org.uk/about-us/news/\">Trees for Life<\/a>, has been leading the project, formerly known as <a href=\"https://treesforlife.org.uk/about-us/east-west-wild/\">East West Wild<\/a>. He has spent more than two years getting land managers, animal stalkers, millionaires and farmhands to sit around a table and talk about getting wildlife back to the land. “We wanted to speak to as many people as possible before making it a public thing, so that people didn’t feel as if they were pressured into being a part of it,” says McDonnell.<\/p> <p>Rewilding is often perceived as trying to remove people – particularly farmers – from the land. In many rural communities, talking about rewilding gets a similar response to insulting someone’s mother. “For some people, just the Trees for Life badge, or the word ‘rewilding’, means that’s it … I might be here talking to you, but we’re not actually having a conversation,” says McDonnell, who called in psychologist Paul Howell to help.<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you are excluding people that you need to connect with and influence, then you’re in some kind of delusional bubble<\/p> <footer> <cite>Paul Howell, psychologist<\/cite> <\/footer> <\/blockquote> <\/aside>  <p>I meet Howell on Dundreggan estate, where work is underway to build a state-of-the-art rewilding centre with 40-bed accommodation, events spaces, classrooms and a cafe. <\/p> <p>Howell says conservationists and rewilders often think they can convert people to their view using a science-based approach, a “campaign and crusade kind of mentality”. This alienates people and makes them do the opposite of what you want, he says. “Science has information that is profoundly useful. But using that to kind of threaten people and bash them over the head isn’t going to get them where they want to go.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"527d360e78bbd77d8e41751dc5d9279b5260a870\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/527d360e78bbd77d8e41751dc5d9279b5260a870/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Psychologist Paul Howell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Psychologist Paul Howell, who worked with Trees for Life to persuade landowners and the community to back the Affric Highlands rewilding project in Scotland.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>“If you are excluding people that you need to connect with and influence, then you’re in some kind of delusional bubble that you are right and they are wrong,” he says. “You don’t know enough about them. Until you’ve developed the maturity to listen to people – and genuinely listen, not listen until they stop talking so you can then tell them what to do – you’re just delusional.”<\/p> <p>Howell says he didn’t want to be some “secret weapon” for McDonnell’s team. His client was Scottish wildlife, and if he could facilitate conversations that led to ecological restoration, that was ‘job done’ for him. If rewilders are really aligned with the landscape, they will be looking at every possible opportunity to engage with the people entwined with it, Howell believes.<\/p> <p>He told McDonnell that rather than seeing Trees for Life as an organisation that can plant trees, it had to plant a vision for rewilding in communities. Talking about rewilding should be like “dating”, in the sense that you approach someone with genuine curiosity and the desire to understand how they’re feeling and how they think, he says.<\/p> <p>Howell welcomes conflict in meetings because it’s meaningful, fruitful and makes things happen. When people are aggressive to McDonnell, Howell tells him to get their number and have a cup of tea with them, look around their farm and understand their point of view. “That’s a radically different attitude. I really believe it’s not passive, it demands more of an individual in terms of their creativity and maturity … it’s a true kind of authentic commitment to something larger than himself.<\/p> <p>“I don’t think it’s rewilding in the way most people think about rewilding, I think it’s truly visionary,” says Howell, who is optimistic about how much this project will achieve. Already, McDonnell has about 25% of the land, 50,000 hectares being managed by people who have signed up to the Affric Highlands project and the hope is that more will join after its official launch. The UK’s largest restoration project is <a href=\"http://cairngormsconnect.org.uk/\">Cairngorms Connect<\/a>, which covers 64,000 hectares (158,000 acres).<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"941ae4d371a8265b631c77f2123be7c790bbe2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/941ae4d371a8265b631c77f2123be7c790bbe2e4/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RSPB staff and volunteers build a natural dam to create an area of wet woodland, in Abernethy Forest Reserve, Cairngorms National Park, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RSPB staff and volunteers build a natural dam to create an area of wet woodland in Abernethy Forest Reserve, part of the Cairngorms Connect restoration project.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Hamblin/NPL/Alamy<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Later that day, I’m sitting in a house on a hill. It belongs to Pete Smith, a hunter who worked in oil for 40 years. McDonnell asked Pete to speak to the naturally sceptical hunting and fishing communities about how Affric Highlands could help them.<\/p> <p>Smith has no interest in rewilding if it means fewer people. What he wants is these landscapes filled with young families, like they used to be. He was initially sceptical about rewilding but sees it as a levelling up mechanism and a way to tackle rural poverty on a grand scale.<\/p> <p>“The economic spin-offs from rewilding could be that we have far more people working in rural areas, living sustainable lives, the whole thing becomes a virtuous cycle,” he says. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/12/rewilding-england-create-rural-jobs-employment-aoe\">recent report from Rewilding Britain<\/a> found rewilding 5% of England could create nearly 20,000 rural jobs, increasing employment by 50% compared with intensive farming.<\/p> <p>Smith also wants to be able to catch fish and deer that are healthy. “Conservation is a huge part of anybody who’s serious about fishing and shooting, or a deerstalker. There’s a huge amount of work that goes into that, and is pretty much unseen … If you’ve got to spend all day scraping around to catch one little fish, or a small skinny deer that you’re stalking, that’s not the best.”<\/p> <p>Planting trees beside rivers creates a better habitat for young fish and a more nutrient-rich river that can support bigger fish, which would be better for angling businesses. People who want to shoot larger, healthier deer, living in a more forested landscape should be supporting this project, Smith says.<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are a lot of ways we can use land better and increase what it can offer<\/p> <footer> <cite>Alan McDonnell, Trees for Life<\/cite> <\/footer> <\/blockquote> <\/aside>  <p>There is no mention of reintroducing wolves and lynx because it creates unnecessary conflict and is a simplification of what rewilding is about.

The process has not been easy or fast. “Transporting wild animals in Argentina is extremely difficult,” says Di Martino. “The international and national transport of wild animals in danger of extinction is forbidden in Argentina, so all transportation for rewilding projects must be done with special permissions that take months to process.<\/p> <p>“The importing of 40 tortoises from Paraguay was an important step, as it was the largest international transporting of individual animals in the framework of a conservation project. Little by little, these barriers are being broken down, but there is still much work to be done.<\/p> <p>“Also, all animals that enter rewilding projects must go through a rigorous quarantine before being released, to avoid introducing undesirable pathogens into the environment.

From the 1850s, before the age of roads and rail, its waterways were engineered into unobstructed channels to create a vast fluvial transport network. Rapids were removed and bends straightened to allow logs to float hundreds of miles downstream for processing. The supply of dead wood that would once have fed into the rivers dwindled as the surrounding birch, pine and spruce was cleared.<\/p> <p>Though timber floating stopped by the 1980s, its legacy of sterility persists: the diversity of habitats that would have existed throughout the meanders and wetlands of a natural river system never returned, and the forestry industry continues to deprive these ecosystems of their dead wood. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38983824_Dredging_of_rapids_for_timber-floating_in_Finland_and_its_effects_on_river-spawning_fish_stocks\">Studies<\/a> of individual rivers have shown, in some cases, the complete decimation of once-thriving populations of fish.<\/p> <p>The stream that flows before us looks healthy enough, but, says Raassina, it is ecologically dead. All the creatures you would expect to see here – including fish, mayflies and other insects – have vanished. An investigation into the tributaries of the Lieksanjoki River failed to return a single brown trout. “We’re basically starting from zero. Our nation has been so shortsighted,” says Raassina.<\/p> <p>He and his two contractors, Janne Ratilainen and Henri Leskinen, have been tasked with restoring life to this 12km (7.5–mile) stretch of the Särkkäjoki, as well as 1.5km of another stream, the Rännänjoki, that crosses into Finland from Russia.

However, the emphasis is ultimately on creating an ecosystem that will sustain itself over time, without the need for constant intervention.<\/p> <p>Raassina’s enthusiasm for the concept is immediately apparent: he has turned up for the day in a hoodie and a baseball cap, both emblazoned with “Rewilding” in an eye-catching comic sans. “I think rewilding is a really good term.

Ideally, these would repopulate the river by themselves, but given the absence of the species in the surrounding area, it is likely that they will have to be reintroduced.<\/p> <p>It is a small start to a monumental task. The country has <a href=\"https://tem.fi/documents/1410877/2937056/Finland+-+Land+of+Islands+and+Waters\">about 650 rivers<\/a>. About 90 of these are major rivers that discharge into the sea or across borders; the rest are tributaries. But the Finnish public has embraced the task of river restoration. Because 60% of Finland’s forests are divided up between hundreds of thousands of private landowners, this has created plenty of work for Raassina, who initially turned down the project because he was too busy.<\/p> <p>What makes this project notable, however, is that the state-owned forestry company Metsähallitus is at the helm. It owns almost a third of Finland’s land, and without this powerhouse onboard, efforts to restore life to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/16/travel/a-land-of-a-thousand-lakes.html\">“land of a thousand lakes<\/a>” will always be piecemeal. If the agency can be persuaded of the value of this work, the potential for Finland’s river systems is enormous. Metsähallitus has worked on water-based restoration projects before, but this is the first time it has explicitly addressed the small creeks and their catchment areas that crisscross the larger part of the land.<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People are starting to understand that rivers and clean waters are like the heart and lungs of the country<\/p> <footer> <cite>Arttu Kuiri<\/cite> <\/footer> <\/blockquote> <\/aside>  <p>“Metsähallitus has been known for restoring swamps and marsh mires, but not so much creeks, rivers and lakes. But more and more, the focus is also turning to these water ecosystems nowadays,” says Arttu Kuiri, who designed the North Karelian part of the programme. He adds that every single one of Finland’s smaller streams would benefit from restoration, but with funding of just under €1m they had to settle on nine river basins.<\/p> <p>“People are starting to understand that rivers and clean waters are like the heart and lungs of the country,” says Kuiri. “Finland doesn’t really have anything else other than nature, and if we are going to ruin that, it doesn’t end well.”<\/p> <p>The scale of the damage means that wholescale river restoration will be no easy task. At Särkkäjoki, Raassina points out that a layer of sediment has gathered on one of the larger rocks. It is barely noticeable – a fine dusting of dirt – and yet it points to another major problem: soil erosion. Finland’s vast peatlands have been carved up by drainage ditches over the years, destabilising its once-waterlogged soils in the name of timber production. If the country is to have healthy rivers again, looking beyond the banks and towards the wider landscape will be essential.<\/p> <p>Kuiri agrees on the need for humans to set the wheels in motion. “We <em>had<\/em> good rivers and they have been healthy, but in a hundred years we have done so much bad to them. We need to revoke that – and the stones won’t move themselves.”<\/p> <p>For now, in North Karelia, the Särkkäjoki looks like it has lost a fight with a particularly industrious beaver – and that, of course, is the point. The chainsaw has done its work.<\/p>","<p>The “elegant, urgent writing” of George Monbiot has seen the author, environmentalist and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgemonbiot\">Guardian columnist <\/a>win the prestigious Orwell prize for journalism.<\/p> <p>The prize is awarded for commentary or reporting that comes closest to meeting the ambition of George Orwell, the novelist, essayist, journalist and critic, to “make political writing into an art”.<\/p> <p>Monbiot won the prize for his almost four-decade-long fight to raise the profiles of a wide range of neglected environmental issues, most recently leading the calls to rewild our desertified and sheep-scraped landscape.<\/p> <p>“In the finest tradition of George Orwell’s journalism, George Monbiot draws on a vast reserve of knowledge to write with wit, elegance, forensic insight, and sustained and justified anger about the most important, and most neglected, crisis facing humanity,” said Isabel Hilton, one of the prize’s judges. <\/p> <p>“His targets range from organised crime to criminal political indifference, and he leaves us in no doubt about what we must do to survive,” added Hilton, who is also a journalist and founder of China Dialogue.<\/p> <p>In his latest book, Regenesis: Feeding the World without Devouring the Planet, Monbiot explains why farming is, in his words, “the most destructive human activity ever to have blighted the Earth” and what we can do to stop it.<\/p> <p>Jean Seaton, director of the Orwell Foundation and professor of media history at the University of Westminster, said: “Orwell took pleasure in flowers, was consoled by watching toads and observed the environment in all his work. George Monbiot has a life of elegant, urgent writing about the single greatest threat we must square up to – Orwell would, I think, approve of his winning the Orwell prize.”<\/p> <p>Monbiot has written a number of bestselling books, including Feral: Rewilding the Land, the Sea and Human Life, Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Out of the Wreckage: a New Politics for an Age of Crisis.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"><\/iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>He has also made a number of viral videos.

Plans include planting trees, enhancing river corridors, restoring peat bogs and creating nature-friendly farming practices.<\/p> <p>The project has been launched after two years of conversations and meetings between local communities and conservationists from rewilding charity Trees for Life. Similar to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/14/farmers-wildeast-hatch-plan-return-area-size-dorset-wild-nature-east-anglia\">WildEast project<\/a> in East Anglia, it is a community-led effort to restore nature over a large area, which organisers hope will be a catalyst for social and economic regeneration.<\/p> <p>“This was once a much more peopled landscape that was rich with wildlife and we think we can find new ways to establish that connection again, today,” said Alan McDonnell, a conservation manager at Trees for Life, and the project leader. “The idea of doing it at scale is that you get a much bigger natural response because you’ve got room for change and dynamism in that landscape.”<\/p> <p>The Affric Highlands initiative is located west of the <a href=\"http://cairngormsconnect.org.uk/\">Cairngorms Connect project<\/a>, which is one of the UK’s largest land restoration projects at 60,000 hectares. In terms of total area, it is three times the size of Cairngorms Connect but at present only a quarter of the Affric Highlands area is managed by people who have signed up, including farmers, landowners and fishers. McDonnell hopes more will get involved once the project has launched.<\/p> <p>One of the challenges has been bringing together people reliant on traditional land management practices to work on large-scale landscape restoration. McDonnell has had meetings with around 50 local stakeholders and has been working with a psychologist to help him communicate with people who might feel sceptical, and to allay the fears of damage to livelihoods that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/12/rewilding-england-create-rural-jobs-employment-aoe\">accompanied other rewilding projects in the UK<\/a>. <\/p> <p>“Rewilding is a word that people define differently. For some people, it’s wolves and bears. For Trees for Life, it’s about the land, and what it can support,” he said. “We’re primarily motivated by the nature that will come with that, but that’s not to say that we don’t value everything that comes with it, so whether it’s opportunities for businesses and job creation, or natural capital and the ability to monetise that, there are a lot of ways we can use land better and increase what it can offer.”<\/p> <p>Native wildlife set to benefit includes a range of river species such as salmon, trout, ospreys and otters, as well as montane species such as golden eagles, red grouse, short-eared owls and mountain hares.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c052ec7e33e6c0b1ff533fb7daaac4569ec83faf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c052ec7e33e6c0b1ff533fb7daaac4569ec83faf/0_0_4896_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mountain hare (Lepus timidus)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mountain hare (<em>Lepus timidus<\/em>) is one of the species set to benefit from the rewilding project.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Hamblin<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Rewilding Europe helped fund the work with a €300,000 (£250,000) grant and it will be the organisation’s first UK project, <a href=\"https://rewildingeurope.com/areas/\">one of nine across the continent<\/a>.

At worst, it is a dangerous distraction while Nigel Farage et al, and the opaque sources of funding behind them, rush to undercut the hard-won progress for climate and nature, health and equity. Of course, we must manage the risk to food security as well as tackle the nature, climate and health crises.<\/p> <p>It is progressive farmers who are doing the real work in changing farming and food systems, by shifting to agroecological and regenerative practices. Agroecology, which allows for rewilding some agricultural land, removes overreliance on fossil fuels, synthetic chemicals and animal feeds. It is a growing movement that could build a fairer, more sustainable food system. Farmers – if given the right policy and market signals – have huge potential to be a force for change.<\/p> <p>The Ukraine war is the latest episode in a future of increasing geopolitical and ecological instability, characterised by competition for power and resources.

The butterfly feeds on sallow flowers in the spring.<\/p> <p>The butterfly was last seen widely in the late 1940s. Since the 1950s there have been only occasional sightings of individual butterflies, often close to the coast, suggesting that a few were arriving from overseas without breeding.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"><\/iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>According to Oates, numbers of the large tortoiseshell are rising on the continent again – possibly because of climate change – and increasing numbers are now crossing the Channel to arrive on the south coast.<\/p> <p>But the picture is confused because some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/13/maverick-rewilders-endangered-species-extinction-conservation-uk-wildlife\">maverick butterfly breeders<\/a> have also been secretly releasing the species.<\/p> <p>Oates said there were too many sightings close to the south coast for all to be the work of breeders, with the species being difficult to rear in captivity as well. “I don’t believe butterfly breeders would all travel to the south coast to let them go.

It seeks out vulnerabilities in the architecture of trees, wrenching, twisting, jamming into fractures, bursting them open, breaking, uprooting, overturning – the macro equivalent of the micro workings of the fungus. Weather and fungi are in league with each other, a creative-destructive pact for the disintegration, decay and rejuvenation of the forest.<\/p> <p>The scarlet elf-cups carry their folklore lightly. They are brightly otherworldly and are left behind by elves, pixies, fairies and those populations of supernatural folk once commonplace in rural culture – now, even talking about them, the words seem so distantly extinct. Medicinal properties, culinary curiosity and scientific revelations keep fungi culturally in the exotically weird, a fifth column in the service of a more-than-human-worldliness. Perhaps instead of seeing the elf-cups as receptacles of myth, they may be thought of as sensory structures.<\/p> <p>Passing Jodrell Bank on the train, the radio telescopes seem to echo elf-cups on a massive scale.

But increasingly, researchers are looking at the nuances of what happened in the decades after wolves were introduced and challenging this approach. <\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f6be74c03d0616c94786d8f6efae9bc6d1ae24a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f6be74c03d0616c94786d8f6efae9bc6d1ae24a/0_0_6187_3948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wolf in Yellowstone national park, USA\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone park in 1995.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Peaco/NPS<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>One of the key impacts wolves had in Yellowstone was to hunt grazing animals such as elk, whose overpopulation was damaging the park. The number of elk in the northern range of Yellowstone went from 19,000 in 1995 before wolves arrived, stabilising at about 6,000 in the years after their reintroduction. With fewer elk there was less pressure on vegetation such as willow and aspen, allowing them to flourish.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"34f81ded-7e3f-47a3-8d82-f05f0fb147ae\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is rewilding?<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>Rewilding is the restoration of nature in places altered by human activity. From releasing apex predators&nbsp;such as&nbsp;jaguars and wolves to making space for native grasslands in urban areas, rewilding can happen on a big or small scale. <br>While there are competing definitions, most have the rebuilding of sustainable ecological health at their core,&nbsp;be it the return of kelp forests on the Sussex coast in England or the reintroduction of mockingbirds on the Galápagos Islands.<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Why has the term become so popular?<\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>Rewilding has captured the public's imagination&nbsp;by being an environmental movement and a science-based process at the same time. With visions of a wilder planet, high<b>-<\/b>profile environmentalists&nbsp;such as&nbsp;David Attenborough and George Monbiot inspired millions with paths to a more biodiverse, ecologically healthy&nbsp;future. The success of rewilding pioneers around the world has shown what is possible: from the restoration&nbsp;of Gorongosa national park in Mozambique after the civil war to the Knepp estate in the south of England.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Does rewilding have universal support? <\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>No. Critics of rewilding fear that the term is being used to justify the removal of humans from&nbsp;the&nbsp;landscape, especially farmers and indigenous communities. In the UK, some have dismissed the concept as a fad for&nbsp;'toffs'&nbsp;and landowners with vast incomes, while others fear it&nbsp;is&nbsp;being used to attack agricultural&nbsp;communities who have farmed areas for hundreds of years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p><strong>Can you rewild? <\/strong><\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>While the boldest rewilding initiatives take place at a landscape scale, small changes can have a big impact. Millions of people changing how they mow their grass or let nature into their gardens, balconies and window sills can add up, providing more space for biodiversity to recover.&nbsp;<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n   <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n <\/gu-atom> \n<\/figure> \n<p>The wolves also indirectly changed the way their prey moved around the park. The elk became less likely to graze large open river valleys because of the fear of attack. This meant that new areas were able to regenerate, creating benefits that cascaded down ecosystems, resulting in habitats for beavers, fish, small mammals, amphibians and insects, among many others.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3035092892279da9e482019253d3ed9038fe357a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3035092892279da9e482019253d3ed9038fe357a/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An elk herd in Yellowstone National Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A herd of elk in Yellowstone: the wolves made them change their grazing habits.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Gamble/NPS<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>“The aspen trees were the perfect visual way of demonstrating how well this reintroduction had worked,” says Rick McIntyre, who was brought in as a “wolf interpreter” in 1994, a year before the wolves arrived. Since then he has gone out to observe the wolves almost every day and has published several books about them. He lives in the village of Silver Gate in the north-east corner of the park. <\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Wild%20world&amp;description=The%20Guardian%27s%20Age%20of%20Extinction%20series%20reports%20on%20rewilding%20efforts%20around%20the%20world%2C%20as%20the%20idea%20of%20managing%20land%20for%20nature%20gains%20momentum.&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2Fseries%2Fwild-world&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"Link to Wild world series\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Wild%20world&amp;description=The%20Guardian%27s%20Age%20of%20Extinction%20series%20reports%20on%20rewilding%20efforts%20around%20the%20world%2C%20as%20the%20idea%20of%20managing%20land%20for%20nature%20gains%20momentum.&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2Fseries%2Fwild-world&amp;links=false\">Interactive<\/a> \n<\/figure> \n<p>On one site near the release pen, in the space of a few years, the aspen went from being constantly grazed down to producing tens of thousands of shoots, which created a forest “nearly as dense as a bamboo thicket”, he wrote in his book, The Rise of Wolf 8<em>.<\/em><\/p> \n<p>But the story was more complicated than that. The changes were partly due to wolves, but they were also caused by other factors, such as the rising number of mountain lions and bears and an increase in human hunting in the north of the park, as well as climatic changes, explains McIntyre in his book. “I’m sympathetic to the results those people published in the early years. It made sense. It explained a lot of things during that time period. But now, in some cases we’re 20 years down the road, and we have a better handle of all these other factors,” he says.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"564489743f5476172cf64b2c812b4b122662effa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/564489743f5476172cf64b2c812b4b122662effa/0_0_7800_5200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aspen trees with Mount Moran in the background, Grand Teton national park, Wyoming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aspen trees in Grand Teton national park, Wyoming. The trees are increasingly being affected by the climate crisis.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominique Braud/Alamy<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>Today, the willow and aspen that thrived along rivers, creeks and marshes where lots of that early research was done have shrivelled because the water table has dropped, according to McIntyre. As the climate is getting warmer there is less of a snowpack, meaning less moisture available for spring plant growth, which is a big factor for the health and survival of aspen and willow. “There are factors that you could not have predicted, that have turned out to be very influential, and perhaps reversing some of the changes documented,” he says.<\/p> \n<p>Ecosystems are large and chaotic, which makes researching them difficult, and some of the techniques used may have had limitations. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13915\">A paper<\/a> published in 2021 looked at how sampling only the tallest aspen in Yellowstone meant researchers overestimated how much it had regenerated by at least a factor of four compared with random sampling. The study concluded that the “results indicate the existence of a trophic cascade that was weaker than is often claimed”. Other researchers have <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3784896\">warned against<\/a> generalising the effects of wolves. In 2010, a <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Wolf-community-ecology%3A-ecosystem-effects-of-Wolves-Hebblewhite-Smith/d5686fa1764d0a03f4bd75e2a57475c1d62f17e2\">paper concluded<\/a> that the trophic impacts of wolves in Banff, Isle Royale and Yellowstone were all different.<\/p> \n<p>When findings appear sensational the media tends to latch on to this optimistic vision, says Prof Dave Mech, a biologist at the US Geological Survey who studies wolves. For example, a 2014 YouTube video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q\">How Wolves Change Rivers<\/a>, has been viewed 43m times. But when those findings are challenged, most people don’t hear about it, because complex and nuanced stories are less appealing. “Scientists are just humans, and wolf reintroductions were such a popular thing and it got a lot of publicity. It’s human nature, it’s not unusual that people jump to these conclusions,” he says.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e1d567e8d03e98cb44c4a1a2f056d1f3f9cccdd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e1d567e8d03e98cb44c4a1a2f056d1f3f9cccdd/0_0_5120_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of timber wolves stalk an elk in Yellowstone national park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two wolves stalk a bull elk in Yellowstone national park.

In Switzerland, the reintroduction of the cats drove a fall in the populations of roe deer and chamois, as well as changes in their behaviour. In Sweden and Norway, however, lynx recolonisation appeared to have no impact on how roe deer moved around in the landscape, suggesting how animals respond to these predators varies between ecosystems.<\/p> \n<p>The UK is a country bereft of intact ecosystems, and bringing back large predators is often seen as a way to reduce deer numbers which are so high they are inhibiting natural woodland regeneration. The UK has a lot of deer because there is an abundance of habitat and food available – not just because there aren’t lynx and wolves hunting them.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"957930b5da575bca9f471cafd772f1aa992f7593\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/957930b5da575bca9f471cafd772f1aa992f7593/0_0_3456_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wild lynx, Switzerland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wild lynx photographed by a remote camera trap in Switzerland.

Bison, Europe’s largest land mammal, create dynamic habitats by knocking down trees, stripping off bark, nibbling vegetation and making dust baths. The European bison was first released back into the wild in 1954 in Poland. Reintroductions in several other European countries followed. The American bison has also been widely reintroduced.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Przewalski’s horse<\/strong> In Mongolia, about 760 Przewalski’s horses roam the steppes despite having disappeared in the wild in 1960.

But the latest chapter in the multi-storied life of one of the fathers of Britain’s environmental movement sees him as a farmer. Which might sound at odds with his background, but Fairlie – true to form – is championing an alternative type of farming, in the shape of the micro-dairy.<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you’ve got a little closed community you can see clearly what people’s needs are and how much you need to produce<\/p> <footer> <cite>Simon Fairlie<\/cite> <\/footer> <\/blockquote> <\/aside>  <p>The man who was part of the original hippy movement, pioneer of the road protest movement and anti-fossil fuel living, is these days happy tending to livestock. But he farms small, running the dairy for the charitable trust in charge of <a href=\"https://monktonwyldcourt.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Monkton Wyld Court<\/a>, a Victorian pile that hosts yoga retreats, campers and various alternative gatherings. He rears two pigs for meat every six months, fed upon the community’s leftover food.<\/p> <p>“That’s what pigs were bred for – they eat the food that would otherwise be a rat problem,” he says. The don’t-eat-food-waste regulations are “to protect the factory farms because if they get swine fever, they cull thousands in one go. Diseases are a part of life. Only in factory farming are they catastrophic.”<\/p> <p>His current pair are called Jim and Bob. Is it difficult to dispatch them to market? “I’m fairly OK with it, but less so with cows. Once you accept that eating meat is a sensible part of human nourishment you’re guided by your head rather than your emotions. Your emotions are flexible and a little bit untrustworthy.

Today’s dairy industry is “dreadful,” he says. “It’s tragic. So many small farms have disappeared and these monstrous farms concentrate far too many nutrients in one place, causing pollution, and even these farms are struggling.”<\/p> <p>Fairlie is convinced that the micro-dairy model is workable in the modern era, and does not require everyone to live in a commune. Small dairies could be attached to small communities, from prisons to residential homes, reducing carbon emissions, pollution and waste. “When you’ve got a little closed community you can see more clearly what people’s needs are and how much you need to produce.”<\/p> <p>He is an eloquent critic of consumerism, but also a defender of activities that many environmentally minded folk now decry – from cattle farming to wood stoves. If that sounds a bit retro, he is also an evangelist for local food and a radical advocate for land reform.<\/p> <p>His generation came of age during the 1960s and matured with the environmental movement through the 1970s and 80s. His new memoir, <em>Going to Seed<\/em>, brilliantly conveys how the ideas of the counterculture have evolved over the years. With his shock of still-dark hair, neckerchief and stout demeanour, Fairlie looks like an authentic countryman, but he was raised in 1950s suburbia and farmed out to boarding schools by his errant father, Henry, a notable Fleet Street journalist who coined the term “the establishment” and had an affair with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/08/hilary-kilmarnock-obituary\" title=\"\">Hilary Amis<\/a>, wife of Kingsley.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dbb168d2f7fa971eb2e13b8d7e256bba943396fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbb168d2f7fa971eb2e13b8d7e256bba943396fb/0_177_6233_3740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The commune at Monkton Wyld works says, Simon Fairlie.

His tribe were then variously known as flower children or freaks; Fairlie prefers the French term “<em>les <\/em><em>marginaux<\/em>”, but the only word that endures is hippy.<\/p> <p>Today’s radical young environmentalists “are just like I was, but they don’t think of themselves as an alienated generation,” says Fairlie. “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg<\/a> is angry and that’s good, but she’s not saying, ‘We’re different from you.’ She’s just saying, ‘We’re younger than you and you’re not living up to your responsibilities.’ We were saying, ‘We are a different culture – we are freaks and you are straights.’ I’m not saying that was right or wrong.”<\/p> <p>Bearing in mind his 1970s motto – “a career is a headlong rush towards doom” – Fairlie lived on communes and took casual jobs to avoid a conventional career cul-de-sac. He embraced the protest movement ignited by the Thatcher government’s Roads for Prosperity building programme in 1989. The movement mobilised a generation of writers, environmental scientists and campaigners. Fairlie’s protests against building a section of the M3 across Twyford Down in Hampshire landed him in Pentonville prison, where his cellmate enthused about a plot of land for sale in Somerset. So began his next adventure: co-founding a fossil fuel-free eco-community called <a href=\"http://www.tinkersbubble.org/\" title=\"\">Tinkers Bubble<\/a> in 1994.<\/p> <p>Fairlie is rather scathing of his 11 years there, criticising the community’s lack of organisation and work ethic. “We were a magnet for nutcases,” he writes. “We hippies actually weren’t too good at working communally.”<\/p> <p>Communes may seem an idea whose time has gone, but Fairlie mounts a spirited defence. A decent proportion of the rural communes established 50 years ago still exist today; they may be more stable than the nuclear family, he argues. Monkton Wyld works, he says, because all 20 or so residents have a job. “To live here, you apply for a role like the gardener or maintenance. It’s a business.” The house hosts “endless yoga retreats”, but also weddings, family weekends and parties. “We’ve had a couple of orgies, even. They were quite interesting. They were very well run.”<\/p> <p><em><strong>And so to the micro-dairy<\/strong><\/em> he runs for the community: the key to truly sustainable food production, he argues, is its scale. He likes the term “plantationocene” to describe the relentless scaling up and intensification of globalised food production with all its associated problems.<\/p> <p>Local food is embodied by his two Jersey cows, Cocoa and Folly. Rather than separating calves from mothers at birth as in conventional dairying, the calves live with their mothers for about three months. Given six acres of grazing, the pair produce 8,000 litres of milk each year – about £11,000-worth of milk, cheese and yoghurt.<\/p> <p>Rather like his journalist father, Fairlie has a keen eye for a trend. When he took up scything, importing modern lightweight scythes from Austria and running how-to-scythe <a href=\"https://monktonwyldcourt.co.uk/scything-land-management-course-2022/\" title=\"\">courses<\/a>, he was surprised to see the trend take off. He wonders whether scythes will be his most lasting legacy – but his years of campaigning on land reform have helped many people seeking to live off-grid. He calls for simple tweaks to the planning system to enable young locals to self-build affordable homes on village edges. But spiralling land prices are reducing the possibility of a back-to-the-land movement for all but the very wealthy.<\/p> <p>He would like to see a revival of the “county farm” system whereby council-owned farms provide affordable tenancies for motivated but landless young farmers. Instead, councils sell off these assets. The landless English often don’t realise how much common land was annexed by private landowners during the enclosures of the Middle Ages. “Breaking up the big estates or making them more accessible is nowhere near the political agenda because the majority of people in England are so detached from the land they don’t realise they’ve been dispossessed,” he says.<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rewilding is a way of pulling in new subsidies for public goods and you’re not actually producing any food<\/p> <\/blockquote> <\/aside>  <p>Some of these big estates may be leading the way on restoring nature, but Fairlie is a rewilding sceptic. “It’s potentially a scam. It’s a way of pulling in new subsidies for ‘public goods’ [such as restoring biodiversity or soils], and you’re not actually producing any food. I’m not totally against rewilding, but I’m very suspicious of it on good agricultural land. If it’s a public good, it should be under public ownership, not be paid for by the public to a landowner for doing sod all.”<\/p> <p>Fairlie took up writing and editing – for the <em><a href=\"https://theecologist.org/\" title=\"\">Ecologist<\/a><\/em> and then the <em><a href=\"https://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Land<\/a><\/em> – only after his father died. What would Henry Fairlie have made of his son’s life today? “He’d be very glad I started writing. That was what he wanted, but he also had an interest in farming as he got older.”<\/p> <p>The critical father would probably also agree with his son’s conclusions about environmental activism. “When you are young and swept up in a revolutionary moment, it’s easy to believe there is everything to win,” writes Fairlie. “When you look back, towards the end of a full life, you realise you have just been treading water – fighting a rearguard action for justice and ecological modesty against the forces of corporate greed and technological rapacity, who have wealth and power on their side. But we can keep a check on these idiots, and limit or delay their excesses.”<\/p> <p><em>Going to Seed: A Countercultural Memoir by Simon Fairlie (Chelsea Green, £14.99) is out now.

Dams affect water quality and underground water levels, cause channel and coastal erosion and beach disappearances, generate greenhouse gas emissions and lead to declines and even extinctions of migratory fish populations, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/27/migratory-river-fish-populations-plunge-76-in-past-50-years\">93% decline of migratory fish in Europe <\/a>in the last 50 years.

The latest report found that 76% of the removals were of small dams and weirs, but 24% were higher than 2 metres. Three countries – Portugal, Montenegro, and Slovakia – recorded their first ever dam removals in 2021. In Finland, a functioning hydropower dam was also dismantled, the first of three on the <a href=\"https://hiitolanjoki.fi/en/\">Hiitolanjoki River<\/a>, which, when completed, is expected to allow landlocked salmon to return to spawning grounds.<\/p> <p>“This is the perfect example to show that when an operating hydropower dam isn’t needed, and energy can be supplied by other sources, it’s worth removing it and recovering the river,” said Fernández Garrido. “The river will be totally free of dams for the first time in over 120 years.”<\/p> <p>Spain removed 108 barriers from its rivers in 2021, including the 13m-high Anllarinos dam, the tallest European dam taken out last year. “Spanish law is one of the best for dealing with dams,” said Rafael Seiz from WWF-Spain’s Freshwater Programme. “Spain has legislation that obligates the owner to pay for its infrastructure removal once they stop using it.” <\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f10e754c8f134d06fa6daf9d1d00acaf1c52d3fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f10e754c8f134d06fa6daf9d1d00acaf1c52d3fb/257_0_4320_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A free-flowing river in Spain. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cantabrian River Basin Authority in Spain removed 50 barriers in 2021.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CRBA<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>“Spain, France, Denmark, Finland and the UK are blazing a trail,” said Fernández Garrido. “There are other countries that need to make strong efforts to start, such as Italy, Portugal and Greece, and almost all countries in eastern Europe, where many proponents of dam removals are still afraid to openly talk about it.”<\/p> <p>With dramatic declines in freshwater fish populations, restoring free-flowing rivers is seen as urgent. “We truly think 2022 will beat 2021, [because] financial aids are being created to help cover the removal costs, like the new <a href=\"https://openrivers.eu/\">Open Rivers Programme<\/a>, which will invest €42.5m over the next six years to help remove river barriers in Europe,” said Fernández Garrido.<\/p> <p>“We really want to see governments from all countries taking action and creating national grants and plans to completely free some of their rivers from obstacles, so there is, at least, a free and healthy river per country.

The site also includes ancient woodland, as well as great crested newts and rare orchids. Red-listed birds on the site include turtle doves, lapwings and grey partridge.<\/p> <p>Rosie Pearson, a planning and environmental campaigner, said she hoped a local campaign would force the plans to be scrapped and allow the area to be rewilded instead.<\/p> <p>She said: “Already seven parish councils have come together to create a network, and a community action group has been created. It’s called Swap: Stop Wethersfield Airfield Prisons.<\/p> <p>“We are in the process of appointing experts to assist in the campaign, and we are working on a better alternative – to see the land sold to a rewilding buyer. We would love to see the site protected. There is a farm adjoining the airfield which has been bought recently for rewilding.”<\/p> <p>Pearson is convening a group of locals, including landowners, to develop and present an alternative plan for the site that would protect the wild areas from construction.<\/p> <p>Building work on the Wethersfield site could begin in 2023 if the proposals are approved. The government is reviewing responses to a consultation of residents conducted last month.<\/p> <p>Braintree district council put forward the location as a possible prison site a few years ago at the request of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), and the council leader, Graham Butland, has said that the complex, comprising two 1,750-inmate prisons and 1,000 parking spaces, could bring funding and jobs to the area.<\/p> <p>The environment minister Victoria Prentis praised the idea, and said in the planning document: “As part of our work to drive down crime, we have committed to creating 18,000 additional prison places by the mid-2020s. We believe that, following detailed feasibility work, land next to Wethersfield airbase would be a good location for two new prisons as part of the prison estates strategy.<\/p> <p>“Our plans, if successful, would bring many benefits to the local community, such as hundreds of jobs during construction, careers within the prison sector and an increased spend in local businesses.”<\/p> <p>But nature charities say by backing such plans, the government is reneging on its promise to protect wildlife.<br><br>Emma Marsh, the RSPB’s director for England, said: “We cannot keep pushing nature into smaller and smaller spaces and demand it fits in with our plans. Across England our wildlife is disappearing and wild spaces that are providing a refuge for our rarest species during the nature and climate emergency are under threat.<br><br>“Our leaders in Westminster championed the Environment Act for delivering the world’s first legally binding targets for halting the decline of wildlife, and yet only a few weeks after being granted royal assent we now need to see nature included in all decision making, including planning, especially when compensation land could take a decade or longer to replace what has been lost under concrete.”<\/p> <p>The MoJ says the development will protect local wildlife. A spokesperson added: “The landscape design strategy for the new prisons seeks as a primary objective to protect local wildlife, plants and trees as much as possible.<\/p> <p>“A lot of care has been taken to understand the existing context of the site, through research, surveys and assessment, to respect the existing rural setting. The layout of the prisons have been designed conscientiously, to ensure that there will be minimal impact to the existing green infrastructure.”<\/p> <p>The local MP, James Cleverly, refused to disclose whether he would support the plans. He told the Guardian: “I have spoken with MoJ ministers, elected members and officials at Braintree district council and local people about the pros and cons of these proposals. This is still at the very earliest stages, and no formal planning application has been submitted. I will continue to engage with local residents and local representatives.”<\/p> <p>• This article was amended on 2 December 2021 to clarify the council’s actions in relation to the site.<\/p>","<p>Yellow grass and unnaturally bare soil around public trees and paths is increasingly a vision of the past, as indiscriminate use of the controversial weedkiller glyphosate is phased out by councils.

However, local Conservative councillors have since begun <a href=\"https://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2021/10/19/weed-infested-pavements-are-putting-people-off-walking-warns-councillor/\">appearing in local newspapers<\/a> complaining about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/aug/22/council-accused-of-taking-rewilding-too-far-as-weeds-take-root-in-brighton\">rewilding having gone too far<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Green Brighton and Hove councillor, Jamie Lloyd, says it’s not about leaving weeds everywhere, but selectively removing them. “It is true that huge weeds growing in the middle of pavements is undesirable,” he said. “So what we need to do is remove those weeds manually”<\/p> <p>And Lloyd says comments he hears while weeding pavements himself indicate it’s “more popular than the sensationalist headlines suggest”.<\/p> <p>“I do agree that you don’t want pavements impassable for people with mobility issues. Actually, the biggest problem for people with mobility issues is people parking their cars on the pavement, which is [a] massive [issue] in Brighton.”<\/p> <p>As far as the glyphosate ban goes, Lloyd says “the benefits are already tangible”, with anecdotally more swifts, swallows and bats seen locally, and a hedgehog spotted in Hove.<\/p> <p>He adds: “We are in a biodiversity emergency. We’ve lost so many insects in the last 20 years – I’ve read [about] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/flying-insect-numbers-have-plunged-by-60-since-2004-gb-survey-finds#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20flying%20insects,on%20Earth%20depends%20on%20insects.\">declines of 60%<\/a>. This is spectacular and extremely worrying – it’s the canary in the mine. We’ve got to throw everything we can at this, and the first thing we can do is stop poisoning them.”<\/p> <h2>Protests<\/h2> <p>Jon Burke was a Hackney councillor responsible for the east London borough beginning to phase out glyphosate in 2018, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2019/may/20/extinction-rebellion-anti-weedkiller-protest-hackney-town-hall-london-in-pictures\">children protested against <\/a>its use outside the town hall. A borough-wide ban began in 2020.<\/p> <p>Burke said: “The major threat presented by glyphosate is the fact that we’re eliminating plants from the public realm in the middle of a mass extinction event.<\/p> <p>“The majority of plants growing in the public realm are not weeds, but a mix of wildflowers and other things. Some of these plants are the only source of food for very specific species of insects. What I wanted to do was change the perception in Hackney, and potentially more broadly in the UK, of what a clean and tidy public realm is. We’ve grown up with this reaction that any kind of plant in the public realm makes it look scruffy and untidy – and yet we have a simultaneously high tolerance in the UK for McDonald’s wrappers in the gutters.”<\/p> <p>Councils have tried different approaches when it comes to replacing glyphosate. Bath and North East Somerset stopped using the weedkiller in July last year in favour of manual or machine weeding. A £950k <a href=\"https://beta.bathnes.gov.uk/clean-and-green-bath-north-east-somerset\">Clean and Green campaign<\/a> was introduced with a dedicated weeding team, while volunteers can also borrow hoes, brushes and shovels. Councillor David Wood said this had “a positive response and support from residents”.<\/p> <p>Other councils have tried alternative weedkillers. In April, <a href=\"https://www.pan-uk.org/london-councils-toxic-pesticides/\">PAN revealed<\/a> London councils were using a “toxic cocktail” of 22 potentially harmful weedkillers, including seven carcinogens and nine that contaminate ground water. <\/p> <p>Mole said that while “the use of glyphosate dwarfs the use of almost every other weedkiller: it’s cheap, it works, and it’s in a lot of products”, replacing one chemical with another was not the answer. <\/p> <p>He said it was about working out the best approach for each area, from hoeing, raking and manual weeding, to hot foam, which combines hot water with a biodegradable insulating foam to kill plant material, or even leaving plants to grow.<\/p> <p>Burke thinks national legislation is needed to ramp up councils’ efforts. “Local authorities shouldn’t just decide, in the middle of a mass extinction event, whether or not they play a role in whether British crops can be pollinated or whether we sustain insect populations.<\/p> <p>“The ways in which local authorities might want to do that could differ, but I don’t think that should be optional as to whether you completely sanitise the public realm or not.”<\/p>","<p>Nature faces a “perfect storm of threats”, campaigners say, after eight wildlife bills promised by Boris Johnson since coming to power have so far failed to see the light of day.<\/p> <p>The government has been accused of reneging on commitments by failing to deliver policies on nature-friendly farming, the use of peat and pesticides, reintroducing beavers and other lost species, and protecting rare marine life.<\/p> <p>There are fears that the ambition to enhance England’s biodiversity has been lost after the prime minister’s authority<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/06/boris-johnson-wins-no-confidence-vote-despite-unexpectedly-large-rebellion\"> became weakened<\/a> and he is having to listen to the right wing of the Conservative party, which <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/02/06/conservative-free-market-approach-solution-energy-woes/\">views green measures<\/a> as too expensive.<\/p> <p>Johnson’s headline ambition in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/06/rich-in-puns-light-on-policy-boris-johnsons-conference-speech\">speech to Conservative conference last year<\/a> was to “build back beaver”, promising they would soon be released into the English countryside, but the government has still not granted permission for the rodents to be released. Conservationists had expected to be given the green light by early summer this year.<\/p> <p>Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said “We are still waiting for approval to release beavers. It is one of many examples of laws which we have been promised, but have not come through.”<\/p> <p>Other promised bills that have not appeared include a ban on horticultural peat use, which has been consulted on but no legislation has been put forward. This would help halt the destruction of England’s peatlands, which are one of the most significant stores of carbon in the country.<\/p> <p>The government also last year promised to form a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/06/lynx-wolves-could-return-england-rewilding-task-force-set-pm/\">species reintroduction taskforce<\/a>, which would look at how to bring back animals that are extinct or almost extinct in England.

Ministers have also not published, as promised, a national action plan on the sustainable use of pesticides.<\/p> <p>Dr Lissa Batey, the head of marine conservation at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “We’re seeing a perfect storm of threats to nature from every quarter caused by government inaction, delay and reneging on commitments. <\/p> <p>“The government can’t keep stalling and jeopardising its targets to halt nature’s decline by 2030, reduce carbon emissions and, ultimately, tackle the biggest threats we face of biodiversity loss and climate change.

For most, carriage-pulling is more of a hobby. People should keep them because they are part of our biodiversity, part of our history.<\/p> <p>“The UN charter of biodiversity imposes a need to sustain both native and kept breeds. Farmed and wild animals have an equal conservation imperative. We can sustain this population but far better if we can get more people keeping, using and registering them.”<\/p> <p>However, Price was keen to note that many breeds of cattle and goat were thriving because of the changing nature of farming. While in recent decades continental breeds, which grow to huge sizes when given supplementary feed and warm housing, have been the norm, native breeds that need less food and warmth to thrive are becoming more popular.<\/p> <p>Although there is an “element of pets and novelty” in keeping goat breeds including Old English, Bagot and Guernsey, many are being kept for their meat and milk by farmers because they need little food and shelter.<\/p> <p>Price explained: “As farming is changing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/englands-farmers-to-be-paid-to-rewild-land\">with subsidies going<\/a>, they are surviving by diversifying and creating a niche product. It’s hard to keep high-input breeds with subsidies going and people are looking more for low-input species. And goats are pretty low-input as they don’t need all the supplementary feed and vet bills that many continental breeds need. Our native breeds were bred to thrive in farming systems that we had at the start of the century – more low environmental impact and low input.”<\/p> <p>Other breeds doing well include Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies, which are becoming popular for use in rewilding projects, as well as native species of cattle.<\/p> <h2>The RBST watchlist<\/h2> <p><strong>Animals at risk<\/strong><\/p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Large White<\/strong><strong> pigs: <\/strong>Large White pigs are moving to the highest priority level on the watchlist.

But what of the often maligned fox? Shouldn’t we include it? I asked Trevor Williams, the founder of fox rescue charity <a href=\"https://foxproject.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Fox Project<\/a>, if we should feed them.<\/p> <p><strong>Hi, Trevor! Seen any good foxes today?<\/strong><br>No, I’m too old to go out with the ambulances, though sometimes I bottle-feed the cubs.<\/p> <p><strong>Cute! Speaking of feeding, I met someone who said they leave dog food out for the foxes claiming it was a) nice, and b) stopped them going through the bins. Is this genius or madness?<\/strong><br>Generally we suggest people don’t feed foxes, because it will undermine their territory if they can’t be bothered to go farther afield. Also, foxes don’t just take what they need – they take what’s available and bury it for later. And if it’s constantly turning up in nextdoor’s flowerpots, they may end up getting in someone to deal with the foxes lethally.<\/p> <p><strong>Lethal? But foxes don’t count as pests, they’re wild. Wouldn’t that be illegal?<\/strong><br>Not quite. There are protections under the Wild Mammals Act, which make certain ways of killing illegal, but pest controllers use legal methods. Thankfully, most people like to see wildlife in their gardens, and feeding them can draw them in. So, if you’re doing that, feed a mixture of protein and roughage – their natural diet includes bone, fur, feather – and only a small amount, so they still need to scavenge. It’s just about compassion.

In Norfolk, there are <a href=\"https://www.north-norfolk.gov.uk/tasks/development-management/nutrient-neutrality/\">no mitigation schemes established yet<\/a>, with all development without full planning permission paused <a href=\"https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/housing/nutrient-neutrality-10000-homes-norfolk-broads-wensum-defra-8897222\">within the catchment of the Broads and the River Wensum<\/a>, both of which contain damaging levels of nutrient pollution.<\/p> <p>The government’s demand for “nitrate neutrality” was welcomed by Rosie Pearson, the chair of the <a href=\"https://www.communityplanningalliance.org/\">Community Planning Alliance<\/a>, a grassroots campaign group for sustainable development.<\/p> <p>“It’s great to see and a rare example of where the public protective system is doing what it should,” she said. “But with councils bound by their five-year housing supply targets and one government department saying: ‘Build, build, build,’ and then Natural England and Defra going: ‘You can’t build, you’re harming the environment,’ it is a complete mess.”<\/p> <p>Mitigating nutrient pollution with the creation of new wetlands was “a sticking plaster” according to Pearson. “All these wetlands will be created that will be great for nature but the government constantly ignores the underlying problem, which is the sewage system.”<\/p> <p>Housebuilders are warning the measures could cost developers up to £5,000 per home and affordable homes and council houses will be delayed. A study in Somerset found that the urban environment contributes 4% of nutrient pollution, with the vast majority caused by farming and sewage discharges.<\/p> <p>James Stevens, the director for cities at the Home Builders Federation, said: “Developing a consistent and standardised mitigation approach on water neutrality is essential to removing the growing block it is causing to housing supply.<\/p> <p>“We are urging government to agree proportionate measures that reflect the contribution of housing delivery to the issue without delay. The situation has already been ongoing for some years and it is imperative that solutions are agreed and implemented urgently.”<\/p> <p>In the Solent, where nutrient neutrality rules began in 2018, it took 18 months for mitigation sites to be established but Natural England said it would be much quicker for the 42 new local authorities because there was a nutrient calculator and £100,000 funding to help councils and developers identify solutions.<\/p> <p>In South Hampshire, nutrient credits bought by developers have enabled more than 3,000 “nutrient-neutral” new homes to be built.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hiwwt.org.uk/Nutrient-Reduction-Expression-Interest-Form\">Hampshire &amp; Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust<\/a> (HIWWT) has used credits to buy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aggie_thompson/status/1382748196972208131\">two farms totalling 450 acres<\/a> in the Solent catchment, rewilding intensively fertilised land that was causing nutrient pollution, restoring biodiversity as well as removing 25% more nitrates than the credits instructed.<\/p> <p>“It’s working,” said Debbie Tann, the chief executive of HIWWT. “It means that development is able to mitigate its impact but it’s really important to acknowledge that pollution in the Solent is terrible and just doing this is not going to clean it up. What we really need to tackle is farming, reducing fertilisers, and the water companies need to tackle sewage discharge.<\/p> <p>“This is a good step by Natural England but we need government to step up on the other issues as well.”<\/p> <p>Melanie Hughes, <a href=\"https://naturalengland.blog.gov.uk/2022/03/18/creating-the-new-homes-and-the-healthy-natural-environment-we-need/\">the director of sustainable development at Natural England<\/a>, said all of the affected protected wetland sites were in “unfavourable condition” because of nutrient pollution, such as stinking mats of algae covering salt marsh in the Solent, which prevent wading birds from feeding in the mud.<\/p> <p>“We can’t carry on polluting in these areas – that’s the line that’s been drawn,” she said. “We’re pleased that we’re using nature-based solutions to help resolve the problem, which have much wider benefits.”<\/p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “We want to protect the environment and deal with the build-up of nutrient pollution whilst building the homes this country needs.<\/p> <p>“While house building is not the primary cause of nutrient build up, we want to introduce measures quickly to allow development to move forward.”<\/p>","<p>The Queen’s jubilee tree planting scheme has been sponsored by companies with links to deforestation, say campaigners.<\/p> <p>Across the country, people have been asked to “plant a tree for the jubilee” in honour of the Queen’s 70 years on the throne.<\/p> <p>The <a href=\"https://queensgreencanopy.org/\">Queen’s Green Canopy<\/a> scheme will dedicate a network of 70 ancient woodlands across the UK and identify 70 ancient trees to “celebrate Her Majesty’s 70 years of service”.<\/p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/30/archbishop-of-canterbury-tests-positive-for-covid-and-will-miss-jubilee-service\">Archbishop of Canterbury tests positive for Covid and will miss jubilee service<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>The move is aimed at reforesting the UK.

These include McDonald’s, which has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/25/revealed-uk-supermarket-and-fast-food-chicken-linked-to-brazil-deforestation-soy-soya\">linked to deforestation in Brazil<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Another platinum sponsor is Coutts, the Queen’s bank.

During 2021, the Drax power station in Yorkshire burned 7.7m tonnes of pellets made from freshly cut (“green”) wood, but there are growing concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/19/drax-dropped-from-index-of-green-energy-firms-amid-biomass-doubts\">sustainability of this practice<\/a>.<\/p> <p>NatWest also invests in the pulp mill UPM, which has been accused of causing deforestation in Uruguay by harvesting trees for paper. The energy company Vattenfall, which trades wood pellets and wood chips to energy companies, is also funded by the group.<\/p> <p>Campaigners have accused the royal family of helping large corporations greenwash their environmental records.<\/p> <p>Louisa Casson, head of forests for Greenpeace UK, said: “Sadly, the number of trees that this scheme might help to plant is a tiny fraction of the number the scheme’s corporate sponsors have helped to destroy. It’s an insult to the volunteers taking part to use their efforts to greenwash the reputations of companies that drive deforestation across the world.”<\/p> <p>Joel Scott-Halkes, a co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/16/chris-packham-meets-crown-estate-to-promote-rewilding-royal-land\">Wild Card<\/a>, added: “The royal family are helping major corporations greenwash their own planet-wrecking activities. As representatives of our nation, they are implicating us all in a shameful cover-up of these global companies’ appalling environmental reputations.<\/p> <p>“As the biggest landowning family in Britain, the royals should be using their time to rewild and reforest their own vast estates – not lending their name to companies like McDonald’s.”<\/p> <p>Wild Card also criticised the scheme for awarding Rentokil platinum sponsorship, when the company advertises its services for the <a href=\"https://www.rentokil.co.uk/insects/\">killing of winged insects<\/a>, numbers of which have declined by <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/digest/flying-insects-have-declined-by-60-percent-in-the-uk-survey-finds\">60% since 2004<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Emma Smart, campaigns coordinator at the NGO, said: “A company that profits from the extermination of bees, ants, moths, wasps and flies essential for survival of tree canopies, vital not just for nature but for humans also, is not just greenwash, it’s ecocidal”.<\/p> <p>Rentokil said: “The type of work we undertake is helping customers to control flies inside food production or food preparation facilities, bed bugs in hotels, cockroaches in kitchens.

Each company who has generously supported the QGC is committed to rigorous and challenging targets on both deforestation and biodiversity.<\/p> <p>“As a charitable initiative which has not received taxpayers’ funding, we are dependent on donors to achieve our objectives, which is to fund tree planting in areas of the greatest need across the UK.<\/p> <p>“Through this support we will continue to plant significant numbers of trees in the autumn through until the end of the platinum jubilee year. The legacy of this campaign will make a difference for future generations and encourage tree planting for a long time into the future.”<\/p> <p>A spokesperson for McDonalds told the Guardian: “McDonald’s is committed to eliminating deforestation from its global supply chains by 2030.<\/p> <p>“2020 saw us reach a major milestone by achieving our goal of supporting deforestation-free supply chains for several of our primary ingredients and materials – beef, chicken (soy in feed), palm oil, coffee and the fibre used in customer packaging.<\/p> <p>“We recognise that we have more work to do. That’s why we are accelerating progress in this area and, as a signatory of the UK Soy Manifesto, are committing to sourcing soy, used both as an ingredient and in the animal feed across our supply chains, from deforestation-free supply chains by the end of 2025.”<\/p> <p>Natwest said it had identified biodiversity and nature loss as an emerging risk for the bank and was a forum member on the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures. <\/p> <p>“Our private bank Coutts is proud to support the planting of trees in schools and deprived urban areas through the Queen’s Green Canopy as part of its wider commitment to inspire tree planting across the UK and support young people to develop green skills and find employment.”<\/p> <p>A spokesperson for Drax disputed that they have links to deforestation, saying some forests they use have doubled in size since the 1950s, and 40% of the wood used in the pellets at Drax Power Station consists of waste (sawdust, chips and shavings from sawmills) or residues left behind after commercial cuts of timber for use in the likes of construction or furniture making.<\/p> <p>• This article was amended on 30 May 2022 to say that Drax power station burns 7.7m tonnes of pellets, rather than “8.3m tonnes made from about 16.6m tonnes of freshly cut wood”.

His book was written with a professional writer.<\/p> <p>One of seven siblings, he was shunted between 13 schools as his bohemian parents – Mark, a farmer and photographer, and Jini, a novelist and painter – constantly moved. Fiennes scraped a few O-levels, dropped out and is still occasionally troubled by his lack of formal schooling. “I suffer hugely from impostor syndrome; I think, ‘why would someone want to listen to me?’” But if he was ever viewed as a black sheep in his family, he never felt it. “My mother’s amazing skill was to encourage six very different individuals to express themselves in whatever way they felt suited them,” he says. <\/p> <p>He worked at the Limelight nightclub in London, hanging with VIPs of the day: LL Cool J, Rick Astley and Bros.

Fiennes believes we have to involve farmers in nature restoration, not by blaming them for the damage caused – that’s driven by policy and agricultural subsidies, he says – but by enlisting them to be part of the solution.<\/p> <p>“We’ve got all these targets – net zero [by 2050] and 30% of land to be protected for nature by 2030, and then we’ve got 70% of England’s land area in agriculture. So the low-hanging fruit is what happens here. Why not create veins of nature through the landscape, connect the landscape through hotspots like the Norfolk coast, and produce healthy, sustainable food that benefits nature?” Fiennes is an advocate of “land sharing” whereby productive farmland is managed so it can be home for wild species, as it once was – for instance, by allowing wider, wilder hedgerows.<\/p> <p>To show how this is done, Fiennes first takes me to Holkham’s marshes, which he has made marshier and wetter through a new system of underground piping, adding grazing by belted Galloway cattle. These measures have stimulated an explosion in breeding natterjack toads and ground-nesting lapwing.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52e786eaff5e0b03f8cb6bbf7d09c6510304d126\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52e786eaff5e0b03f8cb6bbf7d09c6510304d126/0_0_5018_6272/800.jpg\" alt=\"A painted lady butterfly rests on the sand dunes at Holkham beach.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <\/figure>  <ul> <li><p>A painted lady butterfly rests on the sand dunes at Holkham beach.<\/p><\/li> <\/ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/08/mud-glorious-mud-restored-ditches-bring-the-birds-flocking-back-to-norfolk-wetlands-aoe\">Mud, glorious mud: restored ditches bring birds flocking back to Norfolk wetlands<\/a> <\/p> <\/aside>  <p>Then we drive to the iron age hill-fort of Warham Camp, a stunning secret spot of chalk grassland that is probably Norfolk’s butterfly capital. For a decade or so, it has been the only place in the county where the chalkhill blue survives. Suddenly, last summer thousands of these butterflies danced over the fort, along with brown argus and common blue. More butterflies are a sign that millions more less-studied flying insects and pollinators will be thriving too, as well as the birds, bats and shrews that feed on them.<\/p> <p>Fiennes achieved this by increasing the grazing – with cattle followed by sheep – in late summer, after the wildflowers have seeded. Natural England, the government watchdog that advises on the management of special sites, warned Fiennes of “overgrazing” but in fact the livestock’s removal of excess grass growth stopped aggressive grasses crowding out more delicate wildflowers the next year.<\/p> <p>There’s one final task: solving the mystery of the teaspoons. We head into the heart of the marshes and there, beside a grove of trees where cormorants cackle, he points proudly to another success story: nesting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/birdwatch-spoonbills-winter-somerset-marshes-wetlands\" title=\"\">spoonbills<\/a>, a large, once-rare, heron-like wading bird with a spectacular beak that has benefited from the food-rich habitat of Holkham. Forty-five pairs nested last summer, twice as many as in previous years.<\/p> <p>“Spoonbills on a nest!” Fiennes sighs with contentment. Then he points to their young, who have dainty pinkish bills: “And two teaspoons there.”<\/p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1120748/land-healer/9781785947308.html\" title=\"\">Land Healer by Jake Fiennes<\/a> is published by Ebury (£20), available <\/em><em>at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/land-healer-9781785947308?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com<\/a> for £17.40<\/em><\/p> <h2>Jake’s gardening tips: keeping butterflies and other insects happy<\/h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50ca9b772faa0d7094ab259cd8ae101d1f6928c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50ca9b772faa0d7094ab259cd8ae101d1f6928c1/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A holly blue butterfly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <\/figure>  <ul> <li><p>A holly blue butterfly.<\/p><\/li> <\/ul> <p>Even though most of us aren’t farmers, Fiennes believes that his principles can be followed in gardens, too.<\/p> <p>“Think heterogeneity,” says Fiennes. “If you’ve got a window box, instead of having just geraniums, plant something else beside them. If an unexpected seedling appears, give it time instead of picking it out. Don’t be over-controlling; let things evolve. A weed is simply a plant in the wrong place.” Most are also wildflowers which attract butterflies and other insects. Lady’s smock and jack-by-the-hedge are the food-plants for the <strong>orange-tip caterpillar<\/strong>.<\/p> <p>Everyone thinks about providing pollinators with nectar (buddleia is the classic “butterfly bush”). But better to consider their caterpillars’ food-plants. The much-maligned nettle is actually a butterfly superfood: <strong>small tortoiseshell<\/strong>,<strong> peacock<\/strong>,<strong> red admiral<\/strong>,<strong> comma<\/strong> <strong>caterpillars<\/strong> will eat it, but it must be growing in a sunny spot.<\/p> <p>If you have a lawn, leave sections of grass long all summer; a late cut in September allows grass-feeding butterfly caterpillars to safely pupate. Grass-feeding butterflies found in gardens include the <strong>gatekeeper<\/strong>, the <strong>small skipper<\/strong> and the <strong>ringlet<\/strong>.<\/p> <p>Native shrubs and hedges are food for butterfly and moth caterpillars, too: keep ivy and holly for the <strong>holly blue<\/strong>, alder buckthorn and buckthorn for the <strong>brimstone<\/strong> and oak for the treetop-dwelling <strong>purple hairstreak<\/strong>. Elm cultivars can host the rare <strong>white-letter hairstreak<\/strong>.<\/p> <p>“Think hedges and edges” – if you can leave sections of ivy and native hedges uncut for a year or two, this will allow more caterpillars to survive. “Does it look unsightly? No, I think it looks quite attractive,” Fiennes says.<\/p>","<p>It is a typically eye-catching boast by the great provocateur of British brewing. James Watt, co-founder of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/10/brewdog-punk-brewery-beer-scottish-brewer-controversy\">beer company BrewDog<\/a>, pledged to plant “the biggest ever” forest in Scotland to help regenerate ancient woodlands that once carpeted the Highlands.<\/p> <p>BrewDog’s Lost Forest would stretch over a “staggering” 50 sq km (19 sq miles), Watt said, and involve millions of trees. One promotional film said the forest would be “capable of sequestering up to 550,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub> each year”. Good soundbites, but not entirely accurate.<\/p> <p>Kinrara, a former Highland sporting estate, climbs from the River Spey just outside Aviemore high into the sub-Arctic reaches of the Monadhliath Mountains. It is perfectly suited for the millions of birch, oak, rowan, alder and Scots pine trees BrewDog plans to plant.<\/p> <p>To a tourist’s eye, Kinrara is picture perfect. Lone specimens of Scots pine punctuate the skyline alongside a hill track winding into the mountains known as the Burma Road. These veterans are in fact evidence of the loss centuries ago of huge woodlands and forests that once covered the flanks of these hills, a loss BrewDog has pledged to reverse. It also has plans for a distillery, eco-tourism and adventure sports on the site.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d87520c267cf044df191d755af56adf4040b73d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d87520c267cf044df191d755af56adf4040b73d9/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Increased competition has steeply driven up rural land prices\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Increased competition has steeply driven up rural land prices.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>BrewDog paid £8.8m for Kinrara, according to Land Registry records, although many media reports at the time said it cost more than £10m.

There is also a peatland restoration project.<\/p> <p>Watt is the latest of Scotland’s green lairds, a pejorative label coined for the new generation of largely absentee Highland landowners who have bought rural estates with the climate and biodiversity in mind.<\/p> <p>Some, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/16/asos-tycoon-who-lost-children-in-sri-lanka-attacks-thanks-public\">Asos billionaire Anders Povlsen<\/a>, invest their wealth in rewilding and conservation tourism, heavily culling deer, abandoning grouse-shooting and removing sheep to promote natural regeneration and recolonisation by previously persecuted birds of prey.<\/p> <p>Some major corporations, including the investment companies Aviva and Standard Life, have bought land purely to plant forests and restore peatland. That is being driven by pressure from activists and shareholders to cut or offset their emissions.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"995bfedd1ba9f8e876132343bffb6e829d9aab9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/995bfedd1ba9f8e876132343bffb6e829d9aab9b/0_97_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deer fences at Kinrara\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deer fences at Kinrara.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Rural estate agents such as Strutt &amp; Parker and Galbraith report a surge in buyers seeking land for woodlands projects, sometimes exclusively or as additional factors in their quest for a private Highland sporting retreat, increasing competition for the few estates that come onto the market.<\/p> <p>That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/05/tree-planting-drive-scottish-highlands-risks-widening-inequality\">has steeply driven up land prices<\/a>, to the alarm of land reform campaigners who want the Scottish government to break up large Highland estates. Hill ground with natural capital potential can sell for £1,200 to £1,600 an acre, double its value several years ago.<\/p> <p>That demand is expected to intensify. Major corporations have set aside billions of pounds globally to invest in green capital projects.

Most are still at the planning stage.<\/p> <p>Many will be subsidised by Scottish Forestry, the agency that runs the Woodland Carbon Code, which is spending an average of £70m a year over three years to hit a government target to plant 46,500 hectares (115,000 acres) of new woodland and forest by April 2025. Many schemes are small but can also push up the value of rural land, further concentrating wealth in the hands of those able to afford them, say critics.<\/p> <p>BrewDog has applied for forest grant scheme subsidies for the first phase of Lost Forest and could gain up to £1.25m, spread over several years. That will not cover all BrewDog’s costs, which could be significant and include consultancy fees and the culling of about 145 deer to prevent its saplings being grazed to death.<\/p> <p>Early promotions for the Lost Forest suggested each can or pack of Lost Lager sold would fund a tree at Kinrara. A recent advert on BrewDog’s online store on Amazon stated “for every pack we plant a tree in the BrewDog Lost Forest”. A BrewDog tweet offering free packs of Lost Lager in January 2021, which has been taken down, included a film about the Lost Forest under the wording “we’ll plant a tree in our forest” for every pack given away.<\/p> <p>The company denies it intended to claim a tree would be planted at Kinrara for every sale of Lost Lager; it told the Guardian that promotion was linked to an Eden Project forest it supports in Madagascar. It changed its Amazon advert last week after it was flagged by the Guardian and promised to amend the film claiming Kinrara was 50 sq km in size.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/03/kinrara-zip/giv-8251Ht1ppXEK5UB/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/03/kinrara-zip/giv-8251Ht1ppXEK5UB/\">Interactive<\/a> <\/figure>  <p>It said similar claims linking lager sales to tree-planting in the Lost Forest carried in licensed trade newspapers last year were “an error in communication”.

The correct figure was up to 1m tonnes over 100 years, it said.<\/p> <p>BrewDog said the vast bulk of the Lost Forest’s overall costs would be met by the company. It had devoted tens of millions of pounds to making its business “carbon negative”, a spokesperson said. “The Lost Forest will, in time, contribute to our pledge to remove twice as much carbon from the air as we emit.”<\/p> <p>Questions about the Lost Lager promotion were a distraction, he said, since every bottle of beer it sold contributed to its climate strategy. “None of this should distract from the fact that our No 1 priority is to reduce emissions,” he said. “The more beer we sell the more we invest in these schemes.”<\/p>","<p>Farmers must “stand their ground” on price inflation and ensure that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/28/farm-incomes-fall-by-20-in-a-year-due-to-weather-covid-and-brexit\">rising costs they face<\/a> are reflected in the prices paid to them by supermarkets for their produce, the UK’s environment, food and rural affairs secretary has demanded.<\/p> <p>George Eustice told the online Oxford Farming Conference on Thursday that rising input costs should result in higher incomes for farmers, but that increasing farm gate prices need not result in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/09/crisps-soft-drinks-uk-food-prices-inflation-rises\">food inflation for consumers<\/a>.<\/p> <p>“We do need producers to stand their ground and take quite a tough position with retailers to ensure that the money they are paid reflects the costs of their production,” he told the conference.<\/p> <p>He said food prices were rising as a result of international pressures, as the price of farm commodities internationally was linked to energy prices, which have risen strongly as economies have recovered from the coronavirus shock. But he said farmers obtaining more for their produce need not affect consumers.<\/p> <p>“You can have reasonably modest increases in farm gate prices, and significant impact on farm profitability, that does not result in major changes to consumer inflation,” he said.<\/p> <p>Farming leaders reacted sceptically. Producers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/14/supply-chain-must-be-fixed-urgently-to-ensure-food-security-in-the-uk\">wield little power<\/a> against the UK’s mighty supermarkets, a handful of which control the vast majority of the food retail market. The problem of farmers having their margins cut to the bone by supermarkets, and being threatened with the loss of their contracts for speaking out, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/02/british-farmers-supermarket-price-wars\">one of the biggest sources of distress to farmers<\/a> for more than two decades.<\/p> <p>Martin Lines, UK chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said: “It’s very difficult for individual farmers to stand their ground against price pressures from retailers who hold all the bargaining power. There is a role for the government to play in giving farmers more power within the supply chain so they are fairly rewarded for food produced to high environmental standards. Government should intervene to ensure contracts between buyers and sellers are fair.”<\/p> <p>George Dunn, the chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, said: “There is significant imbalance within the supply chain with retailers and food service operators able to wield significant power within the supply chain. Down the years, there have been warnings about the sustainability of the ‘cheap food culture’ to which we have become accustomed and it seems now we are seeing the fulfilment of those past prophecies of doom. However, retailers and food service providers have the means to avoid a catastrophe by allowing their prices to increase.”<\/p> <p>Labour accused the government of letting down farmers. Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, said: “Not only is the government neglecting its duty to support British farmers, leaving them exposed to undercutting through inadequate trade deals, ministers now appear to be washing their hands of that responsibility completely. Our rural businesses deserve better and it’s little wonder many are feeling completely let down by the Conservatives’ failings.”<\/p> <p>The government’s previous efforts to shift the balance of power, by installing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/03/supermarkets-ombudsman-retail-industry\">“groceries code adjudicator”<\/a>, have had limited impact. Jo Lewis, policy director at the Soil Association, said an overhaul of the UK’s food systems was required: “Eustice is right to say farmers need to get a much fairer share of the value of the food they’re producing, but his suggestion that the solution is them ‘standing tough’ with retailers seems far-fetched. <\/p> <p>“Farmers will continue to lack power while they are forced to supply commodity crops into a globalised market for <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/causes-campaigns/ultra-processed-planet/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxIOosOWa9QIV15BoCR3HIgyOEAAYASAAEgK7DvD_BwE\">ultra-processed foods<\/a>. They need infrastructure and skills support from government to help them access shorter, fairer supply chains and they need government to get real food back into shopping baskets by tackling the unhealthy takeover of ultra-processed foods with a national reduction target.”<\/p> <p>She said the government’s response to the national food strategy – which Eustice promised for this spring– would be a key test.<\/p> <p>Eustice also took a robust line on the potential for price rises caused by a shortage of migrant workers, saying that “employers need not look for cheap labour” from the EU. “There is no reason why the price of daffodils should not rise to £1.10,” he said, a reference to warnings from Cornish growers that they cannot harvest their flowers, at devastating cost to their business.<\/p> <p>Eustice cheered farmers by announcing 30% higher payments for environmental stewardship schemes, which reward them for taking basic measures to protect the environment, and there was a cautious welcome from many to his proposals for “environmental land management” contracts that will come into force in 2024, with payments to farmers for a broader range of measures, from soil nurturing and tree-planting, and providing habitats for wildlife, to floodplain and watercourse management.<\/p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/englands-farmers-to-be-paid-to-rewild-land\">plans by the government to support rewilding<\/a> through 10 to 15 large-scale pilot projects of between 500 and 5,000 hectares came under fire. Jyoti Fernandes, policy coordinator at the Landworkers’ Alliance union, representing farmworkers, said: “The danger of this approach is that many of the holdings of this size will be land owned by corporations or landed gentry, which means our public money will continue to flow to the very richest in society, while access to land will become increasingly more difficult for new entrants to farming.”<\/p>","<p>Ricky Gervais is the latest celebrity to join an ambitious year-long storytelling campaign called <a href=\"https://www.rewritingextinction.com/\">Rewriting Extinction<\/a> with the launch of a comic called Bullfight.<\/p> <p>Since it launched in June, more than 300 celebrities, environmental experts and storytellers have collaborated to design more than 150 comics that tackle issues such as deforestation and overconsumption.

I gleefully tweeted that Regent Street, deserted in lockdown, seemed a London from a different era: empty roads and glittering shop windows.<\/p> <p>This was my first moment of enjoyment of the electric vehicle (EV), whose purchase had been the source of considerable domestic tension. An eternal optimist, John was convinced we should dispense with a diesel car. The arrival of a grandchild, living at the opposite diagonal corner of London, tipped the balance. It would cut 30 minutes off a hellish journey.<\/p> <p>I mainly saw negatives. I liked my nippy BMW and had range anxiety. How far could we go before the battery failed? Would we be able to do long drives? Were our meandering journeys through France finished for good? “Of course we’ll go,” John said. ‘The French are way ahead of us when it comes to electric.”<\/p> <p>Not in the Tesla price bracket, we settled on a Renault Zoe. Of the cheaper cars, it had the longest range: about 240 miles on a full charge, weather and driving conditions dependent. But all EVs are expensive – £31,000 for this small and far-from-luxury car. We opted to lease, paying a small amount of cash and then monthly payments.<\/p> <p>From the outset the whole experience was distinctly lacking in frills; a couple of young petrolheads waved us goodbye with minimal induction to the car and no information about the charging infrastructure, except to “use the Zap[-Map] app to find a charge point”.<\/p> <p>One piece of info that would have been handy for our survival was that EVs have incredible acceleration. We had been in eco-mode since purchasing the car, when, on the first trip outside London, we found ourselves labouring up a hill, accelerator flat to the floor and still only hitting 55mph. John reached over and switched off eco-mode “to see what happens”. Pinned against the seats by the sheer force, we took off like a rocket. <\/p> <p>We were on our own trying to figure out the mysteries of the country’s charging network. BP rang, offering us a charging point outside our house. This domestic charging is cheapest but, living in a London terrace, we were ineligible. Instead we became aficionados of charging lamp-posts, relatively common in our area. But, as often with EVs, there is a catch. Wandsworth borough council does not reserve the parking spaces for EVs, so “ordinary” cars park there, displacing EVs, which are forced to hunt around for one of the faster, more expensive chargers.<\/p> <p>There are numerous providers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/23/regional-disparities-in-electric-car-charging-points-revealed\">not very numerous chargers<\/a>. Each provider requires you to download its app and subscribe. They all work differently and prices vary. Many chargers are out of order.<\/p> <p>Problems are most visible on longer journeys. When lockdown was relaxed in May we booked to stay at Derek Gow’s rewilding project in Devon. We planned to stop where there were “clusters” of chargers but still got caught out, idling away an hour in a glum corner of Amesbury in Wiltshire, only to discover the charger had stopped working after 10 minutes.<\/p> <p>After that, it was a hunt for other chargers in obscure garden centres, supermarkets and garages. Some worked, some did not, but we began to meet the community of electric adventurers, passing time waiting for chargers by comparing apps, prices and “worst EV journeys”.<\/p> <p>Most places are willing to help out with charging. They were happy to sling a wire at Gow’s and on the way back, the Bull hotel in Bridport, Dorset – booked last minute – didn’t turn a hair, reserving us a place by an external charging point. “We’d better get used to this,” they said. But plugging into unprepared domestic supplies is not always successful. In June we managed to blow the electrics of our friends’ home in Kent. By July I noticed my range anxiety was fading. I didn’t think twice about a trip to North Yorkshire. I no longer watched the battery gauge. If the car said it would do another 106 miles, it meant it. Stops could be planned confidently. A new mentality was creeping in: “get as far as you can” was replaced by scheduling in longer stops and delays.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c71b040630df3e4c3c618b9c261ca010e189ca72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c71b040630df3e4c3c618b9c261ca010e189ca72/0_147_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"electric chargers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many electric chargers are out of order.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maureen McLean/Rex/Shutterstock<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>But “laid-back” only works up to a point. There were still anxious moments – chargers not working, less-than-helpful helplines and ever more provider registrations. The new anxiety was charge anxiety – not that the car cannot do it, but that chargers will not be available.<\/p> <p>By August it was decision time for France. John was still pushing for the 700-mile journey in this car. I was just as set against it: I could not recall seeing chargers around and my French source said our destination village had a charger that was invariably <em>hors service<\/em>.<\/p> <p>I got my way and was also proved right. Once there and able to look around, it was clear<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/25/uk-replaces-france-as-europe-second-largest-electric-car-market\"> France was not electric car nirvana<\/a> after all. So the French EV adventure still awaits. By autumn the car was a useful, boring thing rather than a source of anxiety. We could drive to and fro to Kent on one charge, smugly travel across central London, laugh at the fuel shortages and reduce charge anxiety by sticking to reliable chargers.<\/p> <p>But I noticed gender division was setting in. John had most of the apps on his phone and did more of the technical side, especially midnight trips to find a lamp-post. This is typical, judging from encounters with the informal club of early adopters, mainly male, around the charging points.<\/p> <p>So, I no longer have diesel particles on my conscience and changes in driving habits augur well for the environment. Conscious of conserving energy, you drive at lower speeds, while travel by train for longer journeys becomes more appealing. But the unnecessarily complicated charger network leaves everything to be desired. There is no universal charge card for all suppliers and far too few chargers overall. This will be a huge problem when EV numbers increase. Lack of government regulation is also ridiculous: as things stand, multiple suppliers face no comeback if they fail to keep chargers working.<\/p> <p>I cannot say the electric car has widened my horizons, but it has made me plan more carefully for reaching them.<\/p>","<p>From the driver’s seat of his pickup truck, Jake Fiennes points to the dark green strips of grass that betray the location of a dried-out saltwater creek system on the Holkham estate in Norfolk. If the early autumn rains allow, a rotary ditcher dragged by a tractor will soon score shallow channels in the sandy soil to excavate many of the old waterways. Fiennes, the estate’s conservation director, and his wardens, Andy and Paul, will then fill them with standing water from the site’s chalk aquifers, part of a plan to transform dozens of fields into grazing wetlands on the 10,000-hectare (25,000-acre) farm and nature reserve.<\/p> <p>Fiennes is certain that next spring will see yet more lapwings, avocets and other rare wetland birds thriving in the mud on the edges of the channels – known as field drains – in the habitat they share with a herd of about 800 cattle.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2307cdda2bee91c5ab7fd07b486adac624329403\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2307cdda2bee91c5ab7fd07b486adac624329403/0_0_5000_3325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Jake Fiennes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jake Fiennes, director of conservation at Holkham in Norfolk.

All those little black flies: that’s chick food.”<\/p> <p>Fiennes, whose five siblings include actors Ralph and Joseph, is a maverick well-suited to British farming’s post-Brexit environmental reformation. With slicked-back white hair interrupted in places by alopecia, he speaks in monologues about the potential for change in agriculture, scanning for the impact of his words with piercing cerulean eyes.<\/p> <p>He took charge at Holkham almost three years ago, after more than two decades running Raveningham estate in south Norfolk, maintaining yields on the 2,200-hectare farm while dedicating large areas to nature. Early in his career, he worked on the Knepp estate made famous by Isabella Tree’s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/wilding-isabella-tree-review-farm-return-nature\">Wilding<\/a>.<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We’ve had a record breeding season for spoonbills.

He is a bridge between farming and conservation: a <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/cross-sector/environment/environment-rh-panel/nfu-environment-forum/meet-environment-forum-member-jake-fiennes/\">regional National Farmers’ Union environment representative<\/a> and a member of the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/about-the-rspb/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/rspb-england-announce-new-advisory-committee/\">RSPB’s England advisory committee<\/a>. Last year, he was the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/17/can-farming-make-space-for-nature\">profile in the New Yorker<\/a>, where, commenting on the 51-year-old’s uniqueness, former journalist Julian Glover, who led a review of England’s national parks system, said “there’s an element of Jake which looks like he could have taken up farming or heroin”.<\/p> <p>Contrary to the warnings of many, Fiennes insists the natural world in Britain is “not as fucked as everyone says”. He unapologetically farms wildlife in the nooks and crannies of unproductive land and adapts incumbent methods. In just three years, Holkham’s lapwing population has returned to numbers last seen at the beginning of the millennium. In 2020, western cattle egrets <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/news/western-cattle-egret-breeds-in-norfolk-for-first-time/\">successfully bred <\/a>in Norfolk for the first time on the estate.<\/p> <p>This year, Fiennes imposed new rules for hundreds of thousands of dog walkers on Holkham beach – one of Britain’s most beautiful – which is visited by nearly a million people every year (“800,000 people in 500,000 cars with 300,000 dogs”), to counteract the fall in numbers of breeding shorebirds.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"45689ab2d6b04b55c8f2d46288050f3d6b8a5dda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45689ab2d6b04b55c8f2d46288050f3d6b8a5dda/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lapwing - Winter Flock in FlightVenellus venellus Welney, Ouse Washes Norfolk, UK BI006981 2F44KP8 Lapwing - Winter Flock in FlightVenellus venellus Welney, Ouse Washes Norfolk, UK BI006981\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holkham’s lapwing population has returned to numbers last seen at the beginning of the millennium.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Coster/Alamy<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>“We’ve just had a record breeding season for spoonbills.

It spews mud high into the sky as it is dragged along by a tractor, carving out channels in the earth.<\/p> <p>Despite the cost of hiring specialist machinery at £25,000 for 100 hours of work – paid for by a grant from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-for-farmers-in-protected-landscapes\">farming in protected landscapes<\/a> – it digs the channels at an impressive rate. The new footdrains, once a feature of wetland management on farms, are a perfect breeding habitat for lapwings, redshanks and their chicks, which feed on invertebrates in the mud, according to <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/conservation/projects/rspb-rotary-ditcher\">RSPB research<\/a>. The expanded wetland habitat across the sites will help more wetland birds successfully breed across the north Norfolk coast, Fiennes hopes.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06ffea5196a7473f7961c55689c6927529e38537\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06ffea5196a7473f7961c55689c6927529e38537/0_0_5000_3325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A ditcher machine throws out mud as it cuts a channel in the soil under a glowering sky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Using a ditcher to recreate old waterways on the Holkham estate.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Si Barber/The Guardian<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>“Low-lying ground is not very farmable.

And after the horrors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/25/mad-cow-disease-british-crisis\" title=\"\">mad cow disease<\/a>, it is strictly forbidden to leave dead farm animals out – they must be taken away and disposed of safely, usually burned.<\/p> <p>However, this has meant the countryside is mostly bereft of carrion for predatory birds such as eagles and vultures to feed on – leaving them to pick at paltry portions of roadkill, putting their lives at risk on busy roads in the process.<\/p> <p>A solution from some bird-lovers is to build a “sky table”, on which they put carrion – dead foxes and deer – and leave it to be fed on by corvids and raptors.

We wanted to provide a rich amount of death for them to feed on.<\/p> <p>He says that this summer white-tailed eagles have flown over the table twice and he is hoping this will soon lead to them coming to feed.<\/p> <p>“The eagles follow the ravens to see where to eat,” he said. “We’ve had ravens, magpies, carrion crows, buzzards, red kites. Woodpeckers have used the carcasses too, and starlings have fed on the grubs and maggots there as the carcasses decompose. It’s providing a wide range of food.”<\/p> <p>Gow, a beef and sheep farmer, is not yet allowed to put dead livestock on his table, but he has called for this rule to change.<\/p> <p>“We have a sanitised countryside, where most of the animals that wander round fields are destined for death, but those deaths will all be in slaughterhouses and abattoirs,” he said. “We take everything from the land and return absolutely nothing. In doing so, we deny the creatures that feed on the death.”<\/p> <p>Gow has inspired others to do the same, including financier and conservationist Ben Goldsmith, who is a Defra board member and the brother of environment minister Lord Goldsmith.<\/p> <p>After seeing Gow’s sky table on Twitter, Goldsmith made his own on his land in Bruton, Somerset. He said: “One of the white-tailed eagles that has been released on the Isle of Wight has been hanging out at Longleat, just down the road from me, so I’m hoping to tempt it over.<\/p> <p>“I made a really simple structure around 8ft high and we chucked a roadkill deer up there,” he said. “The carcasses get eaten within three days, so something’s going there.

This means to get one tree to the point of being established at five years, surviving into adulthood, you would have to plant 1.18 trees if using shelters and two trees without shelters. Rather than using tree guards to obtain a higher survival rate of saplings, scientists concluded that it was better for the environment to go plastic-free.<\/p> <p>Best practice depends on location, and in areas with very high levels of damage by grazing animals such as rabbits, deer and sheep, the study found it was better to use tree guards.<\/p> <p>Prof Mark Miodownik from University College London and one of the paper’s authors said: “Start with the premise you’re not going to use plastic tree guards.

And I’d like to know that the initiatives I support are future-proofed and environmentally sound – the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew has warned that poorly planned tree planting could actually increase CO2 emissions and reduce biodiversity. It recently published <a href=\"https://www.bgci.org/news-events/scientists-lay-out-10-golden-rules-for-restoring-forests/\" title=\"\">10 golden rules for reforestation<\/a>, urging schemes to consider factors such as site suitability and sustainability.<\/p> <p>But where do I start? Which trees are best? Where will they be planted? And who will maintain them?<\/p> <p>Those trees I saw being planted in the Brecon Beacons were giant sequoias – the enormous conifer native to California’s Sierra Nevada range. Their planting was organised by tree enterprise <a href=\"https://onelifeonetree.com/\" title=\"\">One Life One Tree<\/a>. At its site near Abergavenny (one of four), paying patrons had come to offset a lifetime’s carbon footprint by planting one of the world’s largest trees.<\/p> <p>Some argue that planting non-native species can affect native biodiversity. Over thousands of years, a network of interconnected flora, fauna and fungi has evolved alongside our native trees; replace the trees with foreign ones and those relationships may suffer.<\/p> <p>To this end, One Life One Tree is planting native trees, including oak and rowan, alongside the sequoias. “We’re only planting on previously felled monoculture timber plantation land,” says founder Henry Emson. “If we weren’t to take this project on, this land would just be bought by a timber business and restocked with non-native conifers – we are creating a biodiversity increase, not a decrease.”<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33d3fbe17abef73c520acba7d34064ed55772416\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33d3fbe17abef73c520acba7d34064ed55772416/0_955_3311_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sugi rewilding project at a junior school in Barking.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sugi rewilding project at a junior school in Barking, London.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joya Berrow/Sugi<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>These trees are the most powerful on the planet for capturing carbon, he says. Unlike other conifers, such as Douglas fir and Sitka spruce, whose growth plateaus at a certain age, giant sequoias continue to grow and accumulate wood beyond maturity. “So their value for carbon capture keeps going for a millennium.”<\/p> <p>Another common concern with planting non-natives is the potential for “invasiveness”; plants outcompeting UK flora, or harbouring potentially destructive pathogens. To this, Emson says his sequoias are grown in the UK from seed, “so there’s no import of any disease or bugs. Giant sequoias can’t propagate in the UK – they need wildfires – so there’s no threat of them breaking out into the countryside.”<\/p> <p>He began the project by planting a sequoia for each of his children, to give them a head start on their carbon footprint. Emson calculates that, with life expectancy in the UK at about 80 years, and per capita carbon emissions at 6.5 tonnes per annum, a giant sequoia growing to 500 cubic meters can offset a person’s lifetime carbon footprint. “Per hectare, native woodland will capture 400-600 tonnes of CO2 over 100 years. Sequoias spaced as we have them here will capture 6,000 tonnes.” Patrons pay £395 a tree, which contributes to the land cost and maintenance.<\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e9f3f6064e8f5e62ee9443b175a5b3702565b11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e9f3f6064e8f5e62ee9443b175a5b3702565b11/0_169_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Stump up for Trees planting initiative in the Black Mountains\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Stump up for Trees planting initiative in the Black Mountains<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR IMAGE<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>Talking to patrons planting their lifelong sequoias was a heartening experience: parents Richard and Eva were planting a tree for their young son Leon (“it’s for his future”). “I haven’t met a single patron who has been like, ‘I’m doing this so that I can carry on as I was’,” Emson says. “They are conscientious, doing it out of love for the planet. People who are off-setters don’t bother coming out to Wales to plant a tree.”<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cities can also play a role – in the form of urban forests, parks, verges and traffic islands<\/p> <\/blockquote> <\/aside>  <p>“Climate adaptability” is another of Kew’s 10 golden rules. In its tree species database, Forest Research (the UK’s principal organisation for tree studies) lists the giant sequoia as “a species that could be grown more widely throughout Britain with climate warming”. So, colossal conifers native to North America could prove advantageous in their suitability for a warmer climate (there are 150-year-old examples growing well in Welshpool, mid Wales), but Kew’s Dr Kate Hardwick urges caution: “A lot of foresters assume we’re going to need non-native species to deal with climate change. But we just don’t know yet,” she told me. “There’s a huge amount of genetic diversity in our native species and there may well be enough to adapt to the climate change we’re going to experience.”<\/p> <p>Another route to reforestation and carbon capture is through farmland. A little way north of the sequoia grove, in the Black Mountains, is Bryn Arw, pilot site of <a href=\"http://www.stumpupfortrees.org/\" title=\"\">Stump Up For Trees<\/a> (Suft), a charity that tries to persuade landowners to include more trees on their land. Winding lanes lead to the 64-hectare hillside plot, where nurtured saplings face bracing winds and a breathtaking view of the Beacons.<\/p> <p>Its co-founders are Keith Powell, a seventh-generation Black Mountains farmer, and writer Robert Penn, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/15/the-man-who-made-things-out-of-trees-review-robert-penn\" title=\"\">The Man Who Made Things Out of Trees<\/a>. “We think carbon sequestration is really important,” says Powell, “but it comes quite low on the list of the benefits of planting trees.” Improving soil and water quality, and providing for wildlife, are among Suft’s priorities, along with natural flood management. Last winter, 130,000 native trees, including birch, sorbus and oak, were planted here by Suft volunteers and contractors, the first significant tree plant on common land in Wales. <\/p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1e185efc0e803bd60f3024c43a67b907e5d2dea1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e185efc0e803bd60f3024c43a67b907e5d2dea1/0_104_3122_1873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A germling of giant sequoia brown soil green leafs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A germling of giant sequoia brown-soil green leafs.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MXW Stock/Getty Images<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p>But Suft has wider intentions. The charity is persuading farmers to designate a proportion of their least-productive land for tree planting. Carbon capture can then play a role as, once new tree plantings have been validated for Woodland Carbon Units (as regulated by the government-backed Woodland Carbon Code), their carbon sequestration can be sold in the form of carbon credits. “We’re trying to get farmers to see carbon as a crop on marginal or non-food-producing land,” says Powell. “It could provide a sustainable income for farms – and that way it’ll be acceptable all over the country”. Penn tells me that selling carbon credits on a new two-hectare native woodland project could easily realise £10,000 for the landowner. Indeed, “Make it pay”, is the 10th of Kew’s golden rules, recognising that income streams will ensure the sustainability of reforestation projects. <\/p> <p>Cities can play a role in reforestation, too – in the form of urban “forests”, parks, workspace courtyards, roadside verges and traffic islands. Rewilding organisation Sugi plants native saplings densely, so they will mature into forest quickly, and thin naturally as the trees compete for light.<\/p> <p>At one central London primary school, a corner of concrete playground is being replaced with a pocket forest of diverse native species including hazel, dogwood, spindle and holly. “The concept is that the forest becomes self-sustaining very quickly,” says Sugi’s lead forest-maker, James Godfrey-Faussett. “From an environmental point of view, a forest ecosystem is probably the most impactful thing you can do in an urban area; it can affect biodiversity, air quality, communities and the local environment.”<\/p> <p>Employing the “Miyawaki Method” – a reforestation approach using densely planted, locally native species saplings that will naturally thin and mature – Godfrey-Faussett has worked with local businesses and schools across UK cities, establishing plantings as compact as a few square meters. At one central London primary school, he told me, a corner of concrete playground is being replaced with a pocket forest, bringing a dose of nature into the children’s playtime. “The concept is that the forest becomes self-sustaining very quickly.”<\/p> <p>Keeping things community-based was a recurring theme among the initiatives I spoke with. Looking for tree projects around my home in Suffolk, I discovered the Suffolk Tree Warden Network, a voluntary branch of the <a href=\"https://treecouncil.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Tree Council<\/a> which has been cultivating trees for donation from locally collected seeds. “We’re growing them in containers and back gardens,” says volunteer Fe Morris. “A couple of our members have set up tree nurseries in schools.” These trees are given away.“There’s been a really good uptake because everyone is rightly terrified about the climate crisis.”<\/p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We’re trying to get farmers to see carbon as a crop<\/p> <footer> <cite>Keith Powell, Black Mountains farmer<\/cite> <\/footer> <\/blockquote> <\/aside>  <p>But it’s not all about planting new trees. The Woodland Trust, aligning with Kew’s rule “Protect existing forests first”, is seeking to preserve vulnerable ancient woodland. “At one point, woodland would have been the dominant landscape feature of the UK,” says the trust’s Bridget Fox. “But only 3%, on average, of the UK is now ancient woodland.” Places like Wychwood in Oxfordshire or Epping Forest on the outskirts of London are brimming with veteran oaks, lichens, fungi and flowers. “Soil that has only ever been wooded is so rich, supporting not only trees but other plants, bugs, birds, mammals and so on,” says Fox.<\/p> <p>It is this well-established ecosystem that makes ancient woodland so effective at carbon capture. The Woodland Trust says woodlands in the UK hold 213m tonnes of carbon, and ancient and long-established woodlands hold 36% of that, even though they make up just 25% of all woodland. “Yet only 7% of our woodlands – ancient and modern – are in good ecological condition,” adds Fox. “We’re calling for ancient woodlands to have buffer zones around them, which could be newly planted woodland, or just land left for natural regeneration, so it’s protected from noise, pollution and buildings hard up against it, which can compact the soil.”<\/p> <p>The Woodland Trust details numerous ways in which people can get involved. It runs several preservation initiatives, from recording the health of veteran trees in their area via the trust’s <a href=\"https://ati.woodlandtrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Ancient Tree Inventory<\/a>, to helping <a href=\"https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/protecting-trees-and-woods/street-trees/canopy-cover-mapping/\" title=\"\">map urban tree cover<\/a>, which can then be used to lobby councils for more trees or better protection for existing ones. <\/p> <p>It’s clear from the conversations I’ve had that carbon capture reforestation efforts – large or small – must be multifaceted, tackling in particular the growing biodiversity crisis, which scientists say is just as catastrophic as climate change. The Natural History Museum <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2021/october/analysis-warns-global-biodiversity-is-below-safe-limit.html\" title=\"\">warned recently<\/a> that the UK has only half of its entire biodiversity left, with an average of just 53% of its native wildlife – plants, animals and fungi – intact. Their analysis cautions: “This is significantly below the 90% average set as the ‘safe limit’ to maintain the ecological processes such as pollination and nutrient cycling that are vital to our survival.” At Cop26, a Kew group launched the Global Biodiversity Standard, which aims to assure people that the tree-planting projects they support do not prioritise quantity over provision for nature. This will soon be a certification logo to look out for.<\/p> <p>The world my two-year-old son is growing up in will continue to face the carbon challenge, but the thought of it being a world in which our trees and forests might be more valued is comforting.<\/p> <h2><strong>Five things you can do<\/strong><\/h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0de8b9e7ca28a19988b9f79d9a8311e87133a022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0de8b9e7ca28a19988b9f79d9a8311e87133a022/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A local park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Become a tree warden in your local park.<\/span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images<\/span> <\/figcaption> <\/figure>  <p><strong>Plant a tree in your garden<br><\/strong>The <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/\">RHS website<\/a> is a helpful resource for choosing a site-suitable variety of tree.<\/p> <p><strong>Protect existing trees<br><\/strong>Keep an eye on the health of nearby street and park trees by <a href=\"https://treecouncil.org.uk/tree-wardens/\">becoming a tree warden<\/a>.<\/p> <p><strong>Go local<br><\/strong>Help reforest your local area by lobbying your council for more trees.

But there are also those on the left pressing Labour and the Conservatives to take much bolder, more radical action to aim for net zero by 2030.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"72a5e28f-d17c-4585-8633-892cfd2227bf\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p><\/p>\n    <p>Net zero is the commitment to reducing emissions by 100% so that the UK is producing no more carbon than it removes from the atmosphere. This will have to be achieved by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases created by activities such as industrial processes, power generation, transport and intensive agriculture, while removing emissions at the same time by capturing carbon or planting more trees.<\/p>\n    <p>It is considered the minimum necessary to stop dangerous climate breakdown increasing the world’s temperature by more than 1.5 degrees celsius. However, there is a debate about how to get there, and how quickly, and how the costs will be spread. The current UK government wants to meet net zero by 2050, which will necessarily involve replacing gas boilers, moving to electric cars, improving insulation and lowering high-carbon consumption such as flights and meat-eating.<\/p>\n    <p><\/p>\n   <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n <\/gu-atom> \n<\/figure> \n<p>Ahead of the publication of the government’s long-awaited climate change strategy, these are the competing political factions trying to win out in the battle over net zero.<\/p> \n<h2>The blue environmentalists<\/h2> \n<p>The dominance of this tribe in the Conservative party has happened gradually over two years, with the rising influence of Boris Johnson’s wife, Carrie, a committed environmentalist, and her circle of eco-friendly Tories. “If you want to get on these days, you need to be seen as green,” says one Conservative MP who has joined the Conservative Environment Network – apparently out of both ambition and sympathy with its aims.<\/p> \n<p>As a faction that also includes the environment minister Zac Goldsmith and Johnson’s father, Stanley, the environmentalist Tories are on board with tackling carbon emissions but they are just as likely to be heard campaigning on oceans, protecting animals, rewilding and reducing plastic waste.<\/p> \n<p>Boris Johnson, once a sceptic about the climate crisis and ways of tackling it, has form for deriding renewables, such as <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/10154424/Wind-farms-couldnt-pull-the-skin-off-a-rice-pudding-says-Boris-Johnson.html\">claiming<\/a> windfarms could not “pull the skin off a rice pudding”. As recently as 2015, he suggested the idea that the warming climate was caused by humanity was a “primitive fear … without foundation”. But since about 2016 he has talked more about the environment and started mentioning climate change more when he became foreign secretary.<\/p> \n<p>As prime minister, he accepted Theresa May’s target of net zero by 2050 and later signed the UK up to reaching a 78% reduction by 2035. Those who know him say he views a successful Cop26 summit in Glasgow as a potential legacy achievement.<\/p> \n<p>However, there is a frustration among those committed to tackling the climate emergency that the Tory environmentalists – Johnson included – rarely talk about it with enough urgency and the prime minister has failed to lead from the front on Cop26, leaving the negotiations to his envoy, Alok Sharma, and most of the public discussion to his climate spokesperson, Allegra Stratton. With No 10’s net zero strategy, plus those on heating, boilers and hydrogen, having been long delayed, he has been left open to accusations that detailed thinking and motivation is lacking.<\/p> \n<p>His approach is backed in parliament, though, by the Conservative Environment Network, the caucus of more than 100 MPs, which is ever keen to point out that they are in the mainstream of the party when it comes to believing in a carbon neutral future. The group of backbenchers, including Sir Bernard Jenkin, Andrew Mitchell and Damian Green, argues the UK “must continue to lead the way not only in promoting adaptation but also in reducing greenhouse gas emissions”.<\/p> \n<p>Chaired by Zac Goldsmith’s brother, Ben, with Stanley Johnson on the board, it is a sizeable and influential faction. But their language is far from being full of alarm, and the messaging is instead focused on the practical ways of meeting the 2050 pledge, with a series of “net zero champions” looking at different policy areas, from nature-based solutions, electric vehicles and renewables to green homes, sustainable agriculture and green steel.<\/p> \n<h2><strong>The Tory cost-sceptics<\/strong><\/h2> \n<p>A section of Conservatives in Westminster, as well as many party members, would not rank tackling the climate crisis as a major priority. Barely any parliamentarian will publicly deny climate breakdown is happening. But there are plenty prepared to chip away at the idea that it is possible to halt dangerous climate change, especially in the case of the former chancellor Nigel Lawson and his Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). The group is widely seen as a bastion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/09/bbc-radio-4-broke-impartiality-rules-in-nigel-lawson-climate-change-interview\">climate science denial<\/a>, undermining the push for net zero emissions by focusing on criticising the costs to consumers of taking action.<\/p> \n<p>Steve Baker, the prominent Tory backbencher, recently declared he has become a trustee of the GWPF, writing of the “net zero fantasies” and “ruinous economic experiment when we can least afford it”. There is also a small group of Conservative MPs, led by Craig Mackinlay, who argue that voters in their seats will not be able to afford the price tag of net zero, with no discussion of the costs of doing nothing.<\/p> \n<p>At the other end of the spectrum there are those fighting politically behind closed doors for delay to action on net zero emissions or watered down proposals. No ministers will admit to being climate change deniers – despite views from the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, who has argued in favour of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frs1Glq8pmw\">adaptation rather than mitigation<\/a> and changes in behaviour, and David TC Davies, a minister in the Wales Office. But some are known to be opposing the costs and also cautious about lecturing people on what they regard as lifestyle choices, such as driving an electric car, cutting back on flying and eating less meat.<\/p> \n<p>Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is fully signed up to the net zero pledge and the Treasury’s interim strategy report has said it will create opportunities for green jobs and growth. “The transition on growth to 2050 is likely to be small compared to total growth over that period, and it could be slightly positive or slightly negative,” it said. However, Sunak has made it known that a major priority for him is making sure it is affordable for consumers and others have accused him of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/13/treasury-blocking-green-policies-key-to-uk-net-zero-target\">blocking funding for meeting the 2050 target<\/a> while downgrading the rollout of green boilers.<\/p> \n<h2><strong>The Labour net zero pragmatists<\/strong><\/h2> \n<p>Starmer has said tackling the climate emergency is a “burning issue” for his leadership but he also leads the pack within Labour on pragmatism. His language is far more urgent and pressing than that of the government, explicitly referring to the climate emergency rather than change or crisis. He has also warned there is already “dystopia” caused by climate breakdown.<\/p> \n<p>However, Labour’s official policy on climate change is only modestly more stretching than the official government target, aiming at substantially more than 70% reductions by 2030, compared with No 10’s aim of 68%. The agreed language is for the party to aim for “considerably above 70% as an absolute minimum – and as much as we could feasibly cut depending on the situation we inherit from the government previous government”.<\/p> \n<p>Starmer is also reluctant to be specific about how people may have to adapt their lifestyles through eating less meat or taking fewer flights, saying only that “we are all going to have to adapt our behaviour”. With unions such as the GMB warning of the costs to industry and consumers of ditching gas boilers, Starmer has said he sympathises with those worried about the price and called on ministers to show leadership and figure out how to make the options affordable.<\/p> \n<p>Some unions have been instrumental in watering down the party’s ambitions, with a compromise struck at party conference under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership in 2019 to downgrade the target of net zero by 2030 to a pathway to net zero by that date, after they raised concerns about the risk to jobs and industry.<\/p> \n<p>The Lib Dems support a more explicit trajectory than Labour, targeting 75% of emissions reductions by 2030 and net zero by 2045.<\/p> \n<h2><strong>The climate emergency warriors<\/strong><\/h2> \n<p>Many in the Labour party – often those on the left – as well as the Green party are warning that far more bold and radical action is needed to deal with the imminent emergency that the planet faces. At party conferences, there have been motions pushing for a “socialist green new deal” and some activists would still like to see a policy that enshrines a target of net zero by 2030. A campaign run by the group Labour for a Green New Deal has pushed for “nine concrete, radical changes” including a national food service and rapid phase-out of all fossil fuel. Their party conference motion this year will push for public ownership of industries including energy, water, transport, mail and telecommunications to aid the green transition – manifesto commitments from 2019.<\/p> \n<p>Starmer is likely to feel the pressure from the left on the issue of net zero in particular, which is close to the heart of many activists. This wing of the party was sorely disappointed that Rebecca Long-Bailey, an architect of Corbyn’s green deal policies, was sacked as shadow business secretary. She was replaced by Ed Miliband, a former energy secretary in Gordon Brown’s government, who is an expert on the issues, but the policies have not yet gone far enough for the liking of many grassroots activists.<\/p> \n<p>The Green party would like to target the UK reducing its own emissions to net zero by 2030 and seeking to reduce the emissions embedded in its imports to zero as soon as possible. The party – which will soon be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/aug/12/green-party-to-offer-young-intersectional-feminist-leadership\">under new leadership<\/a> – is explicit about the need to reduce the demand for high-carbon consumption, including heating, travel and meat consumption, and recommends that UK policy should encourage small families.<\/p>","<h2>January<\/h2> <p>The year began with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/14/2020-hottest-year-on-record-nasa\">counting up of the damage<\/a> after the catastrophic extreme weather events of 2020, from fires to floods.
